very understandable sorry for the wait please let customer relations know what happened today la
wce riders pay highest fares and translink does not help us when there are train delays buses leave empty amp we walk or wait
wce serves rural areas translink should hold buses or add more when there s long train delays we shouldnt have 2 pay 4 cabs
just heard this figured i d mention it for fellow vancouverites starting oct5 all buses will be a single fare zone

translink says customers will be able to convert faresaver tickets etc into compass card credit
dennisshurd we do much more than check fares amp we will still need to check compass cards
translink says it will start closing some fare gates on skytrain 250k passengers now have a compass card
if everyone has to have one why limit daily sales especially to a number that will half fill a train
there was a highly confrontational male threatening another passenger he exited at edmonds red hoodie sports bag sunglasses
so there s 6 000 available for sale until november 1 what s your daily average ridership
yeah i got texted when it was going to come after i got on it thanks
when i tried to text a bus stop number it won t text me back for some reason _
i think your 106 drivers need a compass three buses to metrotown none to new west from edmonds conspiracy
faqs i take a skytrain and then a bus will i be charged for the skytrain and the bus separately
how i don t see that option just wce passes
if i take the 555 from la glory to burnanby can i use a 1 zone mo pass starting oct 5
oh now it shows up 5 minutes later i texted 56884 and my provider is chatr
i was at a compass machine at waterfront
and what if did that trip all the way to vancouver 555 gt skytrain would a 2 zone mo pass work
i have a compass card with an october 1 zone pass loaded would i be able to use it to get home at 12 45am later
the 6 41 26 bus hasn t shown up yet at stop 51639 at joyce station is it late or not coming at all

thanks will do just annoying as about a dozen of us are stranded then the bus zips along to dc half empty and arrives 5m early
so i bought a monthly pass because i have work tomorrow at the skytrain can i add the paper one to my card
oh i do i have one from when i was in school in the summer
i needed to buy a paper pass in order to get to work tomorrow morning
so i m assuming that s a no to putting the monthly pass onto my card even at the skytrain station
like my dream set up would be to have stored value as well as the monthly pass so that i could transit on buses fine and
then have it take from the stored value when i travel across zones via skytrain
there s a whole band serenading the 99 b line tonight vancouver
hi i want to purchase a compass card how
i was just told that the compas card program goes live oct5 and my sept month pass is good up until then is this true
i bought the compass card from wce at waterfront the online site won t let me add a monthly pass onto it is there a difference
i have just been issued a translink multipass from scrapit for oct 2015 may 2016 will operators be familiar with the pass
can i still buy an add fare if i have a bus transfer ticket like say im bussing from where i am to king george cont
ok i knew about the 2016 thing just checking for travel for say tomorrow lol n ntoo bad i cant use my beta testing card lol
ah that makes sense lmao i saw some people tapping card where it says tap card and not on the actual reader i died laughing ud83d ude02

can t add monthly westcoast compass passes on the waterfront machines this morning many people struggling
why is my 2zone compass pass not working i ve tapped it 3 times and it continually says insufficient fare
but that shouldn t cause any congestion on the bus or anything right
there is no alert on the website still
my compasspass works beautifully it even opens the faregate at the skytrain for me d translink
you d pay the bus driver 1 50 exact fare for both oct 1 amp oct 2 n bus driver said this was impossible had no idea fyi o_o
i was just told by this twitter account that the coach had a problem so i m not sure what you mean
so the 160 just decided not to show
which is more accurate the text message for next bus or the posted time sheet on the bus stop they are giving different info
when will machines in stations start selling compass cards
10 15 people moved right to the edge of the kerb with a few holding their hands up unacceptable for this to happen translink

i went thru the compass machine and it didn t say anywhere i could get a compass card just a ticket
was full just passed us
and i won t be charged addfare unless i cross the second zone boundary on train seabus right 1 2
if i skytrain from 3 to 2 bus into 1 will taking skytrain within zone 1 charge add fare assuming all within an hour
also if i tap in in 1 in 2 tap out and tap in at the same stn then tap out in zone 3 will that be counted as 2x 2 zone trips
faresavers are sold out everywhere already why didn t you guys stock more 1 zone
yes i read they went bankrupt in of september you guys also promised to have tix back on the shelves in a few weeks
hi uh i didn t realize the 50 bus isn t going to granville island what s happening the bus driver didn t announce anything

where can i get a compass card then if there s an issue on 1 zone faresaver tickets

it would be super great if your drivers could actually stop when people clearly indicate the stop they want to get off at
aside from data collection with a 3 zone monthly card do i really need to tap
do you guys have an eta of when the comapass monthly passes will be available for purchase online
hi i bought a compass card yday amp put 40 not knowing there u2019s specific monthly pass i can load can i get refund on that amount
and then buy the monthly pass or can i just top up that amount to make it a mp
ooo nm i read the website and i can get the concession very cool i m excited to get one and load it up for my skytrain use
is my understanding correct that a compass card costs 6 first time if so are we granted that amount in fare on the card
despite having a valid and active 3 zone pass in my physically present compass card what if you forget a tap
ah makes sense are there still discounts on blocks of fare eg 10 one zone 21 50 also if i load a daypass will it auto

got ta remember to tap my card when i get on the bus instead of flashing it to the bus driver translink this is so stupid
closed my eyes on the bus amp remembered a bus trip i once took to kiev then realised i was on translink with my eyes closed amp a creepy smile
i m out of practice i don t remember the best way to sask about a late bus u2026 sask to ask sassily amp often passive aggressively
translink remember how funny it was when bus 33 never showed up no oh you had to be there to get it i guess iwasthere5minsearly
still doesn t explain why the bus driver didn t stop for us the bus wasn t full and he just drove right on by
all i wanted to know was why everyone on the bus was charged more than translink website states their response was unhelpful
the driver looked at me and the bus was empty too with almost no people in the bus not impressed with garbage workers
your 403 north this morning at 10 30ish skipped a bunch of us while the bus was near empty at a bus stop near jones road
no no good bus driver please enjoy your newspaper it s not like the bus was supposed to leave 10min ago translink
the bus was completely empty it was the 345 leaving from stop 51939 at king george he she just passed by the line and left
why they decide to turn on the skytrain s heat on a sunny day will always confuddle me why toohot translink
been waiting for 10 mins for a skytrain i thought this is rush hour millennium line always get shafted translink
why is it that the people with the most annoying voices are the ones who are always found talking loudly on public transit translink
why does translink continue to run the nis line the buses are always empty
this 608 driver says others mentioned too i m always 7 8 minutes early
i swear to god i m always carrying something perishable whenever the bus is late where is the 17 bus going to oak 50082
why is the 22 knight bus always so inconsistent and almost always takes 20 mins for the stop at burnard and nelson
hey why does the 323 at stop 55600 always late im probly gon na be late cause its never on time
what s going on with the c23 buses they re constantly late or don t come
why do you not send out alerts or tweets about cancelled bus runs it happens constantly here in maple ridge
these buses are constantly late amp crowded time to build a skytrain for north amp west van that connects to downtown
when are you guys taking the old buses out of commission they re the ones that are constantly breaking down
why is there a need to constantly pressure wash or do what ever your doing late at night and early in the morning at 3 am
dear translink do all your drivers have to brake so suddenly all the time old ladies are constantly almost falling over
every day i take the skytrain without failure something goes wrong thanks a lot paying to be late for things constantly
i am consistantly and constantly disappointed and frustrated with wtf are the bus times today
well it never arrived at poco stn this bus is constantly late in the last week with new drivers frustrating
buses north on cambie turning left to marine constantly not yeilding to oncoming traffic amp turning into far outside lane stopit
you know translink sucks when the bus is supposed to run every x minutes but is constantly late or doesn t show up
maybe you could teach the driver of 407 bus r7415 a thing or too about braking without me constantly colliding into people things
i caught the bus just not to hear annoying messages on the gold coast trams everytime it stops and starts translink
if i had a dollar for everytime let me down i would have more than 10 you re making me late for my grad god damn it
if i had a dollar for everytime the translink buses were on time i d be owing money
why does translink always give me the wrong time everytime
everytime my bus doesn t come after a closing shift i send the bill for my caffeine addiction to translink
i take the train from school at night almost every wkday y cut the no of trains when it s packed everytime now it s worst
so every time i get on a bus i have to 2 75 the 90minute access time will be gone this fall

you are the best at being 30 min late everyday so go fuck yourself
cwalkker looking for regular transit users highly qualified ppl who frequently use transit not everyday ppl who ride buses

hey i was wondering how long it will take to get to the vogue theatre from renfrew stn if i leave at 6 15pm today
but probably will do again tonight as i was one of the last ones who got on that bus today
you know what sucks leaving my house at 9 50 and not getting on a bus until 10 35 i was passed by 4 25 buses
i was thinking of ways translink could expand the skytrain line past waterfront then realized it would just go into the downtown eastside
thanks 2549 for not stopping for me when i was running for you and i even made it to the stop before you
i was early to the stop by 10 mins it never came to my stop there is always problems with the c44 s
why did my train stop for a long time at metrotown i was already on one and had to get off
i was so fucking zen this morning before ruined he motherfucking day
2 2 today that i was breaking the law by an enthusiastic translink employee ther r so many free spaces going to waste
i was here at 7 20 6 min early and the bus flew by with a not in service sign at 7 25
i was told by rep on phone that this was true initially but more options will become available in another month or 2
call them i was told that other options for fare saver credit will come i called them in october to check
morning commute on wb 188 is getting worse when i realized i was standing right by the front door
i was at the stop at 7 58 it never passed that s complete bs i was at the stop since 7 53
2 days on a row i was at the stop when you claim the bus passed must be your new invisible busses
2 days on a row i was at the stop when you claim the bus passed must be your new invisible busses
all is good my bus was running late so i was still able to make it
i was waiting for the 8 at fraser and broadway for 10 minutes then the bus just drove by at 9 10am he next bus was 5min later
i thought that was the whole point of the 6 i was required to put on there in the first place
asked others to move up in the bus line so more people can stand under the rain cover it was like i was from mars translink
i tapped out at granville this morning and i was still charged a beatrice balance on my compasscard how do i fix this
i have no idea i was too worried about the fact my train is going the other way
i was leaving sapperton wb and wanted to be early so i checked first train which said 5 34 but trains were arriving earlier
we had at least a 20 minute wait that s how long i was there before we got a bus
in the morning i was traveling from joyce to downtown tonight i m traveling from metro town thank you
i was going to ask when the november passes would be available now i know going to do that tomorrow
cool thanks made me super frustrated a month ago cause i was getting the wrong times and waited 30 45 minutes more than once
410 leaving stop 56912 left a minute ago had enough room for a couple more people i was by myself they still zoomed on by
makes sense if i was mistakenly charged for 3 zones how do i resolve that
thanks i was confused when a driver on the c23 just told me to tap out contrary to all the lovely signage around this month
get your shit together i was late to class cos 2 buses didn t show up
checked newwest and metrotown area just to let you know last time i was sent somewhere by you they were out
i was just told that the compas card program goes live oct5 and my sept month pass is good up until then is this true
i was waiting at the 51285 stop maybe four feet away i even waved at the bus when i noticed she wasnt changing lanes
i was just told by this twitter account that the coach had a problem so i m not sure what you mean
i already made it but the seniors been at the stop longer than me and i waited 1o 15 main 49
i waited 30 mins in the pouring rain with the wind constantly blowing just to see two 17 downtown s come by late really
the 6 45 104 22nd street station bus never showed up why i waited 25 minutes for a bus
hey what is up with buses that are scheduled to show up and actually never do i waited 30 min for a bus that came every 15
i waited 25 minutes to get on a skytrain at main street today what s up with the crowded trains
one is scheduled for departure in 70 mins last week i waited for it nextbus said it was coming in 5 min it never did
the 402 always has issues the other day 2 busses didn t show up so i waited 1 5 hours all together
told driver of the 7 35 one that was standing waiting for 7 20 one and i asked did it not go anyway of finding out please
i asked driver and he said just wait for the next bus
i asked the same question before i started using my compass card and was told it would be 1 05 so you can see why i m confused
just got flack from one of your employees when i asked him for the disabled seat he was using 1
lol lol i asked translink about the buses only two leave from antrim on a saturday xx
so when i asked this woman to move out of the door way politely she cursed at me what can i do
i will do that however i asked for your opinion is this acceptable for drivers to do this
i asked the translink app how to get somewhere by 1 30 yesterday and all the options it gave involved time travel apps r gr8
hey guys is there an issue with the trains hearing from people they are stopped

your call centre misinformed me that there would be no cancellation on the bus and that there would actually be 2 coming lies
