@calgarytransit I know this is a difficult time but the PM 148 schedule needs to be fixed. There's random buses added to the schedule, such as the 16:25 to Chinook, that don't show up at all, then there's 45 minute gaps in service. https://t.co/Jp1GoQ2Gmk
@calgarytransit Route 23, Bus 6055
@calgarytransit Getting home from work.
@calgarytransit Good jobs.
@calgarytransit It’s free 😜😜.  Lol
@calgarytransit This is the bus I’m on right now, it’s number 1. Overfilled. When you cut back the number of busses and trains you put both passengers and drivers in danger https://t.co/QIfZjmqxiP
@calgarytransit Thank you. A bus every half hour is all I ask, cause thats what I thought its supposed to be 😂
@calgarytransit Today I got to the stop at 16:15. Previously I'd gone out for the 15:56 and it never showed. Today the 16:31 showed up right on time, but there was no 16:25 bus. As well, when I turned on real time on the app, this is what happened: https://t.co/XvLJsy3SHM

@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 And before this pandemic I have not thought that your schedules have been even half decent.
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Take a seat michaelle
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 I am essentially talking about all bus routes! That said, I have been frustrated by the #10, the #22, 66, 13, what was the 73, 20, one that goes to McKenzie Town Centre, and more.
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 And yes, as far as timing, I am not talking about during this Covid-19 period. Thank you.
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 I have done so many times. On multiple occasions I have asked you guys to have buses running every 15 min.s, more than that, like every 1/2 hour is not acceptable. Thank you.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Pollute more because a bus carries more than one person around and does not pollute as much as if each of these people taking the bus were to drive a car.
@calgarytransit Thanks for all  that you do to keep transit moving my only way to really get around with permanent disability and a walker
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Pollute more? What do busses run on? How long do busses run in a day? How long do I run my vehicle in one day? You’re blind if you think our current public transportation decreases greenhouse gasses.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 True. However, more bus drivers = more tax payers &amp; employed people, and may also  mean more people taking the bus and less pollution and less wear and tear on the roads (assuming less car drivers).
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Wrong. I’m not sure what world you’re living in. How does any type of anything increase with operation costs decrease? More busses = more drivers. More busses = more maintenance plus cost to buy new.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 So you can pollute more for yourself, for your own needs, adding to greenhouse gases, which are currently decreasing as people are driving less now.
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Totally makes sense. That’s why I have a car. You can buy one in Kijiji for $2k that will get you from A to B. That’s not much more than a year of public transportation passes.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Actually, more transit would be less need for security and less lost wages for those who use transit to get to work, etc.
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 But Michaella, have you at all looked how much money it costs to run the public transit we currently have? Wages, maintenance, new cars, security, etc. Everything would have to increase. How much more taxes are you willing to pay? Get a bike or a moped.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 The buses don't always, or often, coordinate well with each other. Aside from that, why should I spend a life time waiting around when I have a million of other things that I could be doing that would help me get more done in my day?
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Even if one catches a bus on time if you need to catch a second one you still end up waiting half and hour longer than necessary.
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Thank you.
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 So, for it to be more convenient for you, because you can’t time bus routes properly, you think the city should spend millions and millions of tax payer dollars so you can have a bus there every 15 minutes instead of every 30 minutes? Good thing you’re not in charge....
@calgarytransit I'm still working, so I rely on it.
@calgarytransit for a 6:30 start because my spouse can drop me off on their way to their job and I can avoid the whole mess of taking the bus.
@calgarytransit Honestly, I am doing everything I can to avoid taking transit right now.  You don’t know who is riding with you and social distancing doesn’t happen much of the time.  Busses are often filthy too, despite claims about how much they are cleaned. Sometimes I get to work at 4:30 am
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Outside of a pandemic, one cool thing would be to advertise, say on the radio, all the benefits &amp; reasons it is good to take public transit &amp; why it is actually better than to drive. Reducing pollution &amp; accidents - thereby decreasing the strain on healthcare and its costs, etc.
Hey @calgarytransit ... the #17 just blew down 23 Ave SE at record speed. Maybe a reminder to slow down.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Moreover, you are forgetting car costs such as maintenance, gas, insurance, and sometimes parking.

@smalgoalie33 @calgarytransit Observe! Hope you didn’t catch it😨
@calgarytransit Before I answer that. Is it policy for Calgary transit to allow people to bring garbage bags on to buses. If theres ever a concern whether its cans that rattle or people's property maybe drivers could do something.
@calgarytransit Calgary Transit says it has been busy cleaning inside its buses and C-trains.
@calgarytransit In Ednonton Transit driver dont allow garbage bags on buses. Never seen a garbage bag on a bus until this whole ride for free started. Yeah I'm paying but I sure see alot of bums not and getting to ride everywhere
@calgarytransit No one said anything in particular to the driver however the old lady that was telling be ayse that guy put his bag in between  her and the person with the bag screamed loud enough the driver had to of heard her. Everyone else did.
@calgarytransit Route 6. Time was when I sent you tweet. This isn't about myself alerting the driver this needs to be delt with before anyone with a garbage bags gets on a bus. Thanks
@calgarytransit Well than it seems your quite alright with bums getting on to buses with Stinky garbage bags full of cans. I cant think of any other transit system allowing this but you do. You dont need any more info if that's your policy. Take care
@calgarytransit Thank you for keeping buses and trains going!   ❤️❤️❤️
@calgarytransit Thank you for bus drivers and staffs who clean up the bus at night time.  How can I go to work daily without their help?!!
I will keep on buying monthly bus pass.  Please do not stop your services.
@calgarytransit did you guys pull an update for your android app? Cause its crashing as soon as I open it. Please fix this I need the app for work since your bus times are all over the place now
@jamlorn @calgarytransit you can buy passes online
@calgarytransit maybe you should have the police start watching 39 ST station.  I'm tired of watching junkies and drug addicts at this stop, and usually all the way south. I will not be getting a pass next month.  I've seen meth, crack pipes, people with needles, JUST THIS WEEK
@calgarytransit Yes I have. And it hasn't fixed it
@calgarytransit Every single day 39 ST is a disaster.  The train is basically a meth lab on wheels right now, morning and afternoon.  No thanks.  Deal with it
Didn’t know I couldn’t pay for the bus with cash right now, but shout out to the @calgarytransit driver who let me on anyways. Because of you I was able to get my medications. 🙏🙏🙏
@calgarytransit hi my neighbor is doing Reno's in his house which isnt the problem the issues is stupid company driver's parking in this bus stop everytime .... https://t.co/Toov8cE0ta
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Furthermore, I want to waste as few days of my short, mortal, life being stuck being bored and sometimes in pain because it is so cold waiting for buses! Every 1/2 hour service during normal times sucks!
@calgarytransit Shuttle buses are 24 to 27 feet in length. The suggested distancing is 6 feet between two people but the shuttle buses have 10 passengers seating limit in COVID-19. Please explain so that I feel safe using transit. https://t.co/PyBM9M90PO
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 I do not want to be punished for making the environmentally responsible decision, of not driving and taking a bus instead.
@calgarytransit Well, transit is still important to me because this is my only way of transportation going to work. So, thank you Calgary Transit for your service eventhough the busses are late and sometimes dirty.

@SheldonBridge1 @calgarytransit I wonder what it is

Hey @calgarytransit it's always annoying when busses leave before they're supposed to but when service has been cut down and that's my (and many others) only way of getting to our essential service jobs it's really annoying when the busses leave 3-5 minutes early.
@calgarytransit @hilaryjahelka It is better for a bus to be 1 or 2 min.s late than leave 2 min.s early, particularly during these times.

Cornered scared animals frequently bite

Raccoons have been known to carry rabies, as a precaution, if you are bit, you get rabies vaccine

A series of rabies vaccine is awful

No vaccine, and rabies in humans is 99.99% fatal
@Crackmacs @calgarytransit @311calgary Quite a lot, actually, and for many years mostly in the south end (Fish Creek, Midnapore, Glenmore, even Bankview) but only in the past 4 years have I had reports of sightings as far north as downtown.

@Crackmacs @calgarytransit @311calgary As others have said Raccoons have become much more common in #YYC in recent years and that trend should continue given available food, few predators and milder winters. 
Here is what I wrote about them in 'Mammals of Alberta' in 1999. https://t.co/Lcfx0Ni1Ej

@calgarytransit @calgarytransit I saw no physical damage but he was kicking some of the doors hard.
@calgarytransit @calgarytransit white male, grey hoodie, blue jacket, grey sweat pants and wearing tan work boots. He had patchy facial hair. He got off at city hall and headed towards McLeod trail.
@calgarytransit there's some high person on train #2447 who was kicking the doors and is creating a potential dangerous situation for the passengers.

@Crackmacs @calgarytransit @311calgary Beauty!!
@HappiJason @BradInYYC @Crackmacs @calgarytransit @311calgary Haha it's a fair question. 
I've always had an issue with approaching wild animals that I shouldn't. I was like 22 before I realized it's more dangerous for the animals than me.
Also, many encounters with unvaccinated dogs/cats/tejones in Mexico that resulted bites or scratches.
@HappiJason @KrysonCJAY @Crackmacs @calgarytransit @311calgary Wrestling wild raccoons apparently 😉
@KrysonCJAY @Crackmacs @calgarytransit @311calgary I call that a "fun fact" 😜😜
@KrysonCJAY @BradInYYC @Crackmacs @calgarytransit @311calgary I’m not casting any shade at you I love you as the fine human being you are so please do take this question the wrong way cause it’s just curiosity 

What have you been doing with your life that you’ve needed 11 rabies shots?
@KrysonCJAY @BradInYYC @Crackmacs @calgarytransit @311calgary I’m just finishing night shift here so I might be over tired but this fascinates  me When was that last time you got a rabies shot 💉
@calgarytransit serious commendation to the driver of route 119 unit 8014. A lady was late due to the train and he gladly waited the extra couple minutes at Saddletowne for her. Had he not done this, she would've had to take a cab to work. Awesome driver!
@KrysonCJAY @BradInYYC @Crackmacs @calgarytransit @311calgary I’ve heard rabies shots are awful and best avoided If it was me I’d check Guinness 11 might be a record

@calgarytransit Is there an estimated time as to when service will resume? When is this going to be back to normal?
@Crackmacs @calgarytransit I hav3 been suggesting this for years. End doors are for entering.  Middle doors are for exiting. It would get people to move to the middle of the car and leave room for others to get on. They always say it is a good idea but have never implemented it.

@calgarytransit In the last few months, there was rollover for the low income bus passes. Will that be happening again for June, or will a June bus pass be needed?
@calgarytransit Thanks for heads up
@calgarytransit are we going back to the original seating capacity on our buses? I just had a over capacity bus drive by me.
@calgarytransit @nenshi @DruhFarrell @gccarra @seanchucalgary @CouncillorKeats @RundleRay I don't normally catch the buses that are affected.

@calgarytransit Oh okay! Thank you!
@calgarytransit Would recommend your 'Plan a Trip' service on your website not include cancelled routes, temporary or otherwise. I can't exactly take the 117 from McKenzie Towne right now (as much as I'd like to and hope to do so again soon). 😏
Hi @calgarytransit! The driver of the bus #23 didn’t stop and ignored me at bus stop# 9477 at 5:50 pm today (May 20, 2020).  I have been waiting for 30 minutes and the driver didn’t stop.  What’s wrong with it
@calgarytransit when will buses start taking cash payments again?
@calgarytransit No problem! Was just trying to plan for going back to work!
@calgarytransit 
Heard from a friend today that we're allowed to use March &amp; April bus passes for May. Is that true?
@calgarytransit Quick note of thanks to Calgary Transit workers. This has been hard on your work hours/efforts and subsequent layoffs b/c ppl, rightfully, are worried about mass anything.

We appreciate all you're doing. AS SOON AS we can feel comfy on C-train again, we'll be back into the cars.
