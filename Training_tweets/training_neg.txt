@calgarytransit I know this is a difficult time but the PM 148 schedule needs to be fixed. There's random buses added to the schedule, such as the 16:25 to Chinook, that don't show up at all, then there's 45 minute gaps in service. https://t.co/Jp1GoQ2Gmk

@calgarytransit Good jobs.
@calgarytransit It 2019s free  d83d de1c d83d de1c.  Lol
@calgarytransit This is the bus I 2019m on right now, it 2019s number 1. Overfilled. When you cut back the number of busses and trains you put both passengers and drivers in danger https://t.co/QIfZjmqxiP
@calgarytransit Thank you. A bus every half hour is all I ask, cause thats what I thought its supposed to be  d83d de02
@calgarytransit Today I got to the stop at 16:15. Previously I'd gone out for the 15:56 and it never showed. Today the 16:31 showed up right on time, but there was no 16:25 bus. As well, when I turned on real time on the app, this is what happened: https://t.co/XvLJsy3SHM

@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 And before this pandemic I have not thought that your schedules have been even half decent.
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Take a seat michaelle
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 I am essentially talking about all bus routes! That said, I have been frustrated by the #10, the #22, 66, 13, what was the 73, 20, one that goes to McKenzie Town Centre, and more.
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 And yes, as far as timing, I am not talking about during this Covid-19 period. Thank you.
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 I have done so many times. On multiple occasions I have asked you guys to have buses running every 15 min.s, more than that, like every 1/2 hour is not acceptable. Thank you.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Pollute more because a bus carries more than one person around and does not pollute as much as if each of these people taking the bus were to drive a car.
@calgarytransit Thanks for all  that you do to keep transit moving my only way to really get around with permanent disability and a walker
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Pollute more? What do busses run on? How long do busses run in a day? How long do I run my vehicle in one day? You 2019re blind if you think our current public transportation decreases greenhouse gasses.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 True. However, more bus drivers = more tax payers &amp; employed people, and may also  mean more people taking the bus and less pollution and less wear and tear on the roads (assuming less car drivers).
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Wrong. I 2019m not sure what world you 2019re living in. How does any type of anything increase with operation costs decrease? More busses = more drivers. More busses = more maintenance plus cost to buy new.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 So you can pollute more for yourself, for your own needs, adding to greenhouse gases, which are currently decreasing as people are driving less now.
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Totally makes sense. That 2019s why I have a car. You can buy one in Kijiji for $2k that will get you from A to B. That 2019s not much more than a year of public transportation passes.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Actually, more transit would be less need for security and less lost wages for those who use transit to get to work, etc.
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 But Michaella, have you at all looked how much money it costs to run the public transit we currently have? Wages, maintenance, new cars, security, etc. Everything would have to increase. How much more taxes are you willing to pay? Get a bike or a moped.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 The buses don't always, or often, coordinate well with each other. Aside from that, why should I spend a life time waiting around when I have a million of other things that I could be doing that would help me get more done in my day?
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Even if one catches a bus on time if you need to catch a second one you still end up waiting half and hour longer than necessary.
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Thank you.
@michaellemagnum @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 So, for it to be more convenient for you, because you can 2019t time bus routes properly, you think the city should spend millions and millions of tax payer dollars so you can have a bus there every 15 minutes instead of every 30 minutes? Good thing you 2019re not in charge....
@calgarytransit I'm still working, so I rely on it.
@calgarytransit for a 6:30 start because my spouse can drop me off on their way to their job and I can avoid the whole mess of taking the bus.
@calgarytransit Honestly, I am doing everything I can to avoid taking transit right now.  You don 2019t know who is riding with you and social distancing doesn 2019t happen much of the time.  Busses are often filthy too, despite claims about how much they are cleaned. Sometimes I get to work at 4:30 am
@calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Outside of a pandemic, one cool thing would be to advertise, say on the radio, all the benefits &amp; reasons it is good to take public transit &amp; why it is actually better than to drive. Reducing pollution &amp; accidents - thereby decreasing the strain on healthcare and its costs, etc.
Hey @calgarytransit ... the #17 just blew down 23 Ave SE at record speed. Maybe a reminder to slow down.
@paradiseofmines @calgarytransit @Jojo00383615 Moreover, you are forgetting car costs such as maintenance, gas, insurance, and sometimes parking.

@calgarytransit Before I answer that. Is it policy for Calgary transit to allow people to bring garbage bags on to buses. If theres ever a concern whether its cans that rattle or people's property maybe drivers could do something.
@calgarytransit Calgary Transit says it has been busy cleaning inside its buses and C-trains.
@calgarytransit In Ednonton Transit driver dont allow garbage bags on buses. Never seen a garbage bag on a bus until this whole ride for free started. Yeah I'm paying but I sure see alot of bums not and getting to ride everywhere
@calgarytransit No one said anything in particular to the driver however the old lady that was telling be ayse that guy put his bag in between  her and the person with the bag screamed loud enough the driver had to of heard her. Everyone else did.
@calgarytransit Route 6. Time was when I sent you tweet. This isn't about myself alerting the driver this needs to be delt with before anyone with a garbage bags gets on a bus. Thanks
@calgarytransit Well than it seems your quite alright with bums getting on to buses with Stinky garbage bags full of cans. I cant think of any other transit system allowing this but you do. You dont need any more info if that's your policy. Take care
@calgarytransit Thank you for keeping buses and trains going!    2764 fe0f 2764 fe0f 2764 fe0f

@calgarytransit maybe you should have the police start watching 39 ST station.  I'm tired of watching junkies and drug addicts at this stop, and usually all the way south. I will not be getting a pass next month.  I've seen meth, crack pipes, people with needles, JUST THIS WEEK
@calgarytransit Yes I have. And it hasn't fixed it
@calgarytransit Every single day 39 ST is a disaster.  The train is basically a meth lab on wheels right now, morning and afternoon.  No thanks.  Deal with it

Hey @calgarytransit it's always annoying when busses leave before they're supposed to but when service has been cut down and that's my (and many others) only way of getting to our essential service jobs it's really annoying when the busses leave 3-5 minutes early.

@Crackmacs @calgarytransit @311calgary As others have said Raccoons have become much more common in #YYC in recent years and that trend should continue given available food, few predators and milder winters.  Here is what I wrote about them in 'Mammals of Alberta' in 1999. https://t.co/Lcfx0Ni1Ej

@calgarytransit Is there an estimated time as to when service will resume? When is this going to be back to normal?
@Crackmacs @calgarytransit I hav3 been suggesting this for years. End doors are for entering.  Middle doors are for exiting. It would get people to move to the middle of the car and leave room for others to get on. They always say it is a good idea but have never implemented it.

@calgarytransit you got a group of people prepping to smoke some hard drugs in one of the shelters at chinook station right now.
@Crackmacs @calgarytransit Weren 2019t they closed because of crime?
@NautilusShell @calgarytransit No idea. They are sending out conflicting info. They were open yesterday (I'm still going to work everyday) and today suddenly no access. No signage.
@calgarytransit Unfortunately there were no signs on the platforms doors indicating a full closure. Just the ones stating 6pm to 6am. The only signage was at the south end of the platform near the level crossing.
@calgarytransit Thanks for clearing that up!
@calgarytransit So the station heads are now closed around the clock at those five Red Line stations? When did that start, as previously it was 6 pm to 6 am closures?
@calgarytransit When making this decision was there any consideration taken in to customers needing to take a longer walk to the bus loops and now will be missing already tight connection times due to the cut back of service?

@calgarytransit Are ypu doing the same in buses too? I just want to know coz i use the bus.
@calgarytransit Thank you very much for all your efforts.
@calgarytransit Upper deck of Brentwood station 2 guys so high they might fall down
@calgarytransit You can miss them grubby dirty, I 2019m a already at the platform
@calgarytransit 1 had blonde hair with a black cap, black jeans black hoodie
@calgarytransit Okay sorry I should have done that when passed them
@calgarytransit Okay and the other guy has a beige jacket and on the ground chocolate milk container
@calgarytransit Not a problem
Hello @calgarytransit, how much is the monthly pass for international students? My uPass expired last April 30, 2020. Thank you.
@calgarytransit why are shuttles going to the opposite sides of train stations then where the signs for shuttles are posted?
@calgarytransit Franklin station, signs are posted only on the northbound side with shuttles only on the southbound.
@calgarytransit #BlueLineShuttle you need to tell your operators to cool it, people are confused and ask questions, operators shouldn 2019t be so rude!.
@calgarytransit are buses free right now? I didn't have to pay today because you guys aren't providing transfers?
@calgarytransit why have a time when the bus comes? Its never at that time. As well you think if it says it's going to leave a train station it would leave on time not 5 mins before its says it will depart.  I should stop paying because I usually have to get an uber anyway
@calgarytransit What about low income Adults pass and regular pass. Are they up for sale?
@calgarytransit The driver of bus 8012 just passed stop 8711 where there was a person waiting, despite the fact that the person was standing up and was clearly visible from the road
@calgarytransit hi, I want to know if the student pass still available now for the train
@calgarytransit The college one
@calgarytransit I 2019ve been waiting for the bus 5 minutes before its schedule and when I looked in the app again the schedule was changed. It left 10 minutes early. Don 2019t they have to  follow the schedule? I 2019m sory to say this but Calgary Transit has wasted a lot of my time. https://t.co/zTl0b8plef
@calgarytransit I was at the stop around 2:30 waiting for the 2:38 one but when I checked again it said the bus already left at 2:29.
@calgarytransit Here 2019s another problem. I couldn 2019t check where the bus was on the gps because the schedule can change but the gps doesn 2019t seem to cooperate sometimes
@calgarytransit The first time I checked was around 2:27 and it said the bus would be there in 7 minutes so I went to the stop, then time passed and it hadn 2019t come so I checked again at 2:37
@calgarytransit No, I decided to take the train instead.
@calgarytransit wtf I'm currently in a train car where 43 other people are on.  Driver kept letting people on.  Wth
@calgarytransit this is crap having to miss my train because I can't enter station &amp; run all the way to the other end of the platform... https://t.co/LWprIPdKJ8
@calgarytransit Hi, is there a way I can check departures of buses early this afternoon? I just want to verify something. Thank you.
@calgarytransit Hi sorry, it was the 406 bus, from seton to somerset bridlewood station. supposed to be there at 12:23 pm, stop is at wb seton dr @ main st se
@calgarytransit now that drivers are asking for tickets again on shuttle buses, are we supposed to deposit ticket on big buses? And how do transfers work if I don 2019t have a ripped ticket?
@calgarytransit How do transfers work when I board a shuttle and deposit my ticket?
@calgarytransit Are you able to verify if it did depart on time this afternoon at 12:23?or was there a significant delay?
@calgarytransit But my shuttle driver asked me to deposit my (already ripped) ticket in the box. I have nothing to show on my next connection if prompted.
@calgarytransit the shelter and bench at stop 9267 could use a good power washing.
@calgarytransit Let me be clear, I am paying and want to pay. I 2019ve been ripping and tossing tickets as needed. I just don 2019t get how it works when some drivers collect the paper but don 2019t have a transfer to offer in exchange.
@calgarytransit Yeah I dunno what this is but a power wash ought to take care of it https://t.co/0NIBTjeBc1
@calgarytransit Did it reach somerset on its scheduled time as well? Thank you,  I just need the info for a family member
@calgarytransit Twice now. Most recent was #15 this evening. I 2019m not transferring, this time, but I have a medical appointment this week that will require 1-2 transfers each way so I want to know what to expect.
@calgarytransit is the google maps app accurate if it said it departed on time?
@calgarytransit Thanks! And to be clear, not complaining about the driver, just confused as to the current process.
@calgarytransit i see, thanks. and there is also no logs or timestamps of actual arrival and departures of buses that i can get the info i need?
@calgarytransit Thanks, I will...
@calgarytransit i have an appointment for my dog 2019s check up tomorrow and im just wondering if small dogs are still allowed in the train and bus?
@calgarytransit car 2409 southbound train... a guy in a hockey mask has scissors in his hand gripped like a weapon. Hes not yet threatening anyonem
@calgarytransit Okay thanks :)
@calgarytransit gotta go downtown in the morning. Is the 300 running normally or at least in sync with the app?
@calgarytransit hi! With the new changes happening lately, is transit still going to be the same? As in, boarding via the back, Honor system for fares? Is there a set  201cend date 201d currently?
@calgarytransit there are sparks coming from a broken light at the off ramp 16 Ave ne / Stoney trail ne
@calgarytransit Six weeks after locking down shelters at LRT stations, you put up signs telling customers what you 2019re doing. Now, if only you opened them back up at or near the posted time.
@calgarytransit TY
@calgarytransit Maybe instead of punishing paying customers they should tackle the real problem. Why treat riders that travel between 6PM and 6AM as second class customers ?
@calgarytransit how do passengers show the bus driver their bus pass or put a bus ticket into a box as payment for the ride if passengers are boarding the bus from the backdoor and not supposed to walk up to the driver?
@calgarytransit Thank you !
@calgarytransit Thank you

Hay @calgarytransit can you open all doors at sunalta station please and thanks
@calgarytransit Gotta wondering how many people are actually waiting for the train right now.
@calgarytransit Good morning my friend how 2019s it going coffee time?
@calgarytransit The Calgary Transit system is the worst and most tax payer wasting urban public transit system in the country...
@calgarytransit The Calgary Transit Ststem is horrible... even when times are slow they can 2019t get it right...
@calgarytransit Don't threaten me....back to regular....blah blah
@cityofcalgary @GlobalCalgary @CBCCalgary @calgaryherald @CTVCalgary @calgarytransit @cityofcalgary
@calgarytransit IS TRANSIT FREE RIGHT NOW??? I bought a May pass for $109 and not a single driver has asked to see it???
@calgarytransit I am definitely having a great day so far riding my early birthday gift.
@calgarytransit Tomorrow
@calgarytransit Thank you. I will be turning 34.
@calgarytransit The mask train.
@calgarytransit I certainly did.
@calgarytransit Also first time in a month ride Calgary Transit.
@calgarytransit I 2019m on train #2328 heading south towards Somerset Bridlewood. There is a man who is physically unwell &amp; under the influence. Can you please send someone to help/alert the driver?

@calgarytransit So if there's limited time at chinook does that mean the platform will be closed ??
@calgarytransit I don 2019t like to rat anyone out, but the driver of the route 13 using bus 7940 has no idea where they are going.
@calgarytransit Ok and will that be all the shelters thats at the bud loops ?
@calgarytransit There is a detour on 8 street sw where there is a water main break south of 17th ave. And myself and another passenger had to direct the driver through the detour and then back on the main route to 14 street
@calgarytransit It 2019s not a big deal, I know these are trying times for everyone. But a little better route preparation for your drivers would be good. I expected that from a weekend shuttle driver, not a weekday newflyer driver.
@calgarytransit I don 2019t want to get anyone in trouble, some better route planning would be good.
@calgarytransit Ok thank you
@calgarytransit How do I become a transit supervisor? I would make a kick ass one.

@calgarytransit I 2019ve been in 3 buses today and none of them would let me use the front just the back. With the back is hard to get up and my stroller didn 2019t fit threw the isle they just watched me struggle  so maybe ask bus drivers to be letting stroller threw the front for the ramp all 42 bus

@calgarytransit Can you also pass a special thanks along to the morning weekday bus driver on the route 74. He's always saying good morning when you get on his bus, &amp; he gives you a wave. Then he tells everyone to have a good day/weekend as you get off.

While I am grateful for @calgarytransit, it is discomforting to observe social profiling in the downtown core. At the last stop before the free fare ends, peace officers are asking people who look homeless to vacate the train before asking for proof of payment. #askforpayment

@CTVCalgary @calgarytransit @CTVMarkVillani Very sad to hear about layoffs at this time.  But we heard Calgary 2019s mayor say  201cridership was down 90% 201d yet services were only cut by 15%... It 2019s no wonder Calgary is having such financial hardship during these very difficult times.
@calgarytransit  Please ensure bus drivers are told to  open back doors and not expect passengers to do so.  It's too hard for those with mobility issues as backdoors won't stay open unless drivers do so.

@calgarytransit I take an earlier one its supposed to be there at 4:58 they've been coming at 5 this entire week.
@calgarytransit 2 to 3 minutes normally I wouldn't care but I only have 2 to 3 minutes to catch the 23 when it arrives at falshire drive stop so those few minutes they're late make a difference

@nenshi Suggestion: $.05 tax on YYC gas = $100mil in revenue/ year. Takes care of $89mil shortfall. Encourages transit use. Sustainable mobility. Cuts to @calgarytransit will limit area of transit space, increase density and spread of #COVID19AB. AB Transportation: 1667 L/person.
@calgarytransit paramedics attending to medical emergency on car at Shag Point. I called 911 and stayed on until paramedics arrived. 911 operator asked if there was a defibrillator. I couldn't find one. Should I have been able to find one on the car or at the statio?

RT @cityofcalgary: We want to thank all frontline workers &amp; essential service staff; you 2019re doing an incredible job.  We will be showcasing 2026
@calgarytransit when will routes be returning to regular schedules? It's making early morning trips as an essential worker very difficult and adding so much extra time to the trips.
@CoryBMorgan The @calgarytransit is set to lay off 400-500 staff.  That 2019s where maybe the money will come from.
@GlobalCalgary @calgarytransit @nenshi  Just as more retail &amp;service sector employees return to their jobs via....you guessed it transit, along with us essentials. Not everybody has a vehicle or drives Everyone deserves a safe distant ride to work and home. Bring back those Transit employees.

@calgarytransit Route 444, your website says it runs every 40 mins all day however the app says it only runs peak times. Can you please confirm which it is as that's a route I now have to take regularly to go to work.
@calgarytransit Ok thanks.
@calgarytransit With all the upcoming cuts, when will we see revised schedules and what was cut?

@calgarytransit No, I took the 38 but the other person waiting left. I noticed the schedule changed from 5:31 to 5:29 recently but wondered with layoffs coming if it had been reduced.
@calgarytransit @CTVCalgary just announced masks are mandatory on transit. I don't think this is true??
@calgarytransit When/where can I find out what routes will be affected by the cuts announced yesterday, to be effective May 25th?
@calgarytransit Just another example of the shoddy Calgary Transit System. A strain on the tax payer and a failure as a service. The only people that win as a result of this cluster fuk is the union...
@CBCtanya @RosieBarton @cbcnewsbc Hopefully @calgarytransit does the same - drivers are essential workers who need hours to survive! Especially when they only gat paid a bit over minimum wage...
Meanwhile, crickets from #abgov about supporting @takeETSalert and @calgarytransit with ramping back up for reopening.

@calgarytransit   is the something going on that's new? Bus driver was just so rude kicking people off buses with out Fare?  People had money ready but he said I cant take money than threw a hole bunch of people off? https://t.co/2h5NfbVucu
@calgarytransit His conduct was defeneitly not becoming of a public servant. The lady next to me gave me her phone number in case you would like to call her. The Asian drivers use of profanity was not called for. I also like to say that those patterns did nothing to be provoked of it
@calgarytransit I've seen transit riders pick up since last week. The buses and also C Trains are more packed now then I have seen in the last 2 months.
@calgarytransit EB New Brighton Gate @ 52nd St SE bus stop the garbage can is overflowing. There are dog poop bags and garbage laying all over the sidewalk around it. Time to empty!!
@kipsy1979 @calgarytransit I'm not saying you should do this, Calgary Transit, but maybe tell drivers if people try to pay with money, let the passengers get on for free on a case-by-case basis: https://t.co/oZfYmuDf2E

@calgarytransit This should have happened two months ago when the distancing started. Not now when the restrictions are going to be lifted slowly.
@Evan_Kayne @calgarytransit Amazing I pay 111 for a bus pass and the last two months have been nothing but horrid experiences one after another. Between the homeless just polluting our transit - bus drivers who clearly care less about their job than most. And Edmonton showing Calgaru how it should be done!
For those who don't have a car to drive, getting groceries, going to the COVID 19 test sites, going to see the doctor just got a lot harder due to all the @calgarytransit cancelled routes.  it would be a good idea to reduce the service on all the routes slated for cancelation.
@kipsy1979 @calgarytransit So everyone can ride free then. Good to know. Always see the same ones riding free.
@calgarytransit I agree service should be reduced. However I don't think it should be cancelled. Some folks don't have cars &amp; can't afford a taxi ride to the grocery store, and to the covid 19 test sites. How are they suppose to get where they need to go if the bus isn't running in there area? https://t.co/g8DhDOx4Qe
RT @acrosspoem2: For those who don't have a car to drive, getting groceries, going to the COVID 19 test sites, going to see the doctor just 2026
@calgarytransit What is the point of making people with low incomes buy a pass s when no bus is is able to take them to / from the grocery store due to the route being canceled? https://t.co/SOvJXKwwAl
@calgarytransit Note I do agree with service being reduced. But I also know some communities don't have grocery stores in them that are affordable, which causes people to travel outside of their so they can get their needs met. I also know some folks can't drive or don't have a car to drive.
@TheAlexCHC @goodfoodyyc @povertytalks @Actionhall @VibrantCalgary first @calgarytransit announces that low income folks have to buy the bus pass, then they cut some routes that serve them. It makes no sense to me. Don't they know people in poverty live in all city quadrants?
@calgarytransit What are you people thinking?!? With plans in the books to reopen the city and get people back to work you cut routes and reduce services?? This will lead to overcrowded busses resulting in a greater risk of not allowing proper social distancing and in effect increasing the risks
@kipsy1979 @calgarytransit You are taking a complaint because the driver wouldnt let them ride free. So your siding with the free riding passengers during to taking a complaint against the driver. So everyone can ride free.
@hanacurrie @calgarytransit @Tito2985 As you can clearly see he pays bills
@Tito2985 @calgarytransit I mean just going to throw it out there you could be greatful that you have a place to live and shelter,rather than seeing them as #methheads see them as a person.The reason why the homeless population is so high in Calgary is because people like you are too inconsiderate to help
@calgarytransit Sorry, route 38, just south of the whitehorn LRT station, south bound on 36 st ne
@calgarytransit are bus passes still available to purchase? I've just realized I am probably returning to work next week and dont have one.
@calgarytransit Terrible news. More time wasted waiting for the bus and train.
@calgarytransit sorry I know it's rough for you all right now, can I just get a confirmation on my tweet from earlier about what ctv said on tv this morning?
@jamlorn @calgarytransit My only issue is the use of the The F bomb in front of half the bus when no buddy provoked him or did anything other than get on the bus. That's for your useless thoughts though :)   have a great rest of day. Never with my time again though lol

@CalgaryPolice @cultureyyc @calgarytransit - I need to catch the #3 by 9AM going to Heritage. So, should I just walk to Victoria park for the C-train, given the above?
@RachelZCurrie @Tito2985 @calgarytransit He did not call the Metheads he said addicts which is reality. We can have compassion but this does not mean we have to watch it, and be fearful from being at a station. Our stations should be a drug / alcohol free zone where we feel safe
@kathangel2014 @Tito2985 @calgarytransit Why are you scared of drug addicts? Such a stigma! You should be happy you have a warm coat and shelter rather than having to hide in shelters overnight to try and survive. We can have compassion? So what kick them out of the only place they can possibly survive? Ahah what a joke
@RachelZCurrie @Tito2985 @calgarytransit No joke. You dont know my story. I dont need to explain why I may be fearful, you dont know or obviously care about what I have experienced. I am grateful for my health, and my life but I or others dont have to watch others doing drugs or consuming alcohol in public spaces
@calgarytransit So...with the city starting to open (too soon) you reduce service. When more people will be using transit. Crowding the busses even further making it even more of a risk for your customers and drivers. Great thinking!
@calgarytransit I think we get the message now. You can put it to rest.
@calgarytransit Calgary transit is a joke. Kinda embarrassed on what you guys are doing
@calgarytransit Love the 1987 photo of SAIT station!
@calgarytransit any info about whether low march pass rolling into june.
@calgarytransit If the restaurants and stores are closed along the bus routes are closed, where can the bus drivers wash their hands / use the toilet? The bus driver yesterday needed to go but could find an open washroom on route till he got to a gas station.
@calgarytransit These should be located at the bus terminals too. Train is often last, not first, stop on a multi-leg trip.
@calgarytransit hey a guy on bus 5 #8262 is about to smoke crack on the bus. Black hat bald sitting at the back of the bus. Also not social distancing from others.
@bobandannie @CharmC_Arm Its 230 to 11pm and both times of day @calgarytransit is fcuked up, adds an extra hour in travel, to the day, when I say extra I mean it takes 40 mins both ways normally, add 1 hour to that because its outside 'peak'  They're shift is 8am to 6pm if you work outside these hours  d83d dd95

@calgarytransit just want to point out it 2019s pretty inconvenient when you keep reducing times and services, yet the province announced stuff is gradually opening, so morons are out here crowding trains and buses, causing us to wait for different trains or buses that aren 2019t packed
@calgarytransit Wish you cared about the employees that drive those buses everyday the way you seem to care about social distancing at a park
@bellsong @calgarytransit 79/80 were so much better.  Calgary Transit planners forced the 99 and 95 upon the community, regardless of the overwhelming negative feedback.

@CDNHockeyFan8 @calgarytransit They 2019ll adapt as needed but ridership is way down as is so in most cases social distancing can still be observed.

@calgarytransit Good morning! Couple questions: 1. Is transit free right now? Because someone I know said they took the bus, had to get on using the rear doors and could not approach the driver at all.  2. Is the monthly pass deadline going to be extended into June?
@kurt_pearson @newsmanbluesman @CalgaryToday Maybe @calgarytransit should check into offering this value-added service on some routes?
@calgarytransit I question why you would have express busses running during the shutdown (133 specifically) and then May 25 when people are going back to work you chose to suspend the route?   That is completely backwards, now is the time people will start back to work!
@calgarytransit @tracyinkits Your wrong to base on the past two months, you should have known ridership would be down and now it's going to increase. Common sense should prevail here!

@calgarytransit if I'm boarding the bus through the back, what do I do with my bus ticket?
@calgarytransit This is on 2264 currently at Somerset-Bridlewood station. https://t.co/UVYeiBCzUp
@Chuckwagonracer @calgarytransit But you said the driver  2018refused 2019to let you  201cof? 201d So which is it?
@calgarytransit Your basing future ridership during a pandemic on current ridership &amp; making adjustments weeks later, so when buses become overcrowded based on ridership after relaunch of stage 1, you'll take another few weeks to ramp up service? Placing riders (nurse here) at higher risk. https://t.co/0WoknoSaUM

Heya @calgarytransit  i relied on 2 technologies for bus times your App and teletext for the 167   Both said arriving at 5:58  i left at 552 and had to run for it bus driver said his schedule is 5:52   So  why cant i rely on the 2 technologies you provide for accurate times ???
Its so darn frustrating @calgarytransit the poor bus drivers have been given their schedules why cant u make them available to the app or teletext  not hard WHY IS YOUR APP ALWAYS WRONG??
@calgarytransit The trains are empty thanks to Spendshi, Notley and Turdeau.

@calgarytransit With the economy opening up, why slash services now? It wasn't done earlier  but now common sense would say see what happens with ridership as things open. Less service and vehicles at 50% but more demand... makes no sense whatsoever.
@calgarytransit How about parking all those empty buses? Huge buses with only one or two passengers is a disgrace.

@calgarytransit Good evening CT how are you guys doing this evening?
@calgarytransit Yes I have a question for you
@calgarytransit I noticed that the real time GPS feed has been going up and down today is there a reason why? Is it because of the schedule change starting may 25?

@calgarytransit is BRT 300 still running?

@calgarytransit Thanks!
@calgarytransit I'd bet a lot that the people in charge of this account didn't use transit before the pandemic.  They won't be using it with you peasants now.  I'm sure you have cars and use them.
Please contact @calgarytransit to find out what took so long to protect the drivers, up to Monday they had ZERO protection and now your cutting their hours AGAIN. 19.5 Hours a week so they won't qualify for the emergency benefit and they won't be able to live. But you hired new

@calgarytransit When folks return to work on the 25th &amp; buses become more crowded, increasing the risk to us  immunocompromised essentials, will transit then increase routes frequencies or at the very least have drivers use ONLY the double long coaches? Ive already passed up rides dt crowding

@calgarytransit I am doing good trying to stay busy. Hay I have a question for you regarding low income pass still good to use reminder of May ?
@calgarytransit Thanks.
Having access to transit for low income families &amp; individuals is crucial, it may be the only way many can get to work, medical appts &amp; groceries during COVID-19. @calgarytransit   Edmonton could shut down public transit for the summer, mayor says.  https://t.co/lp5mldBE2L

@calgarytransit I have called CTA. They emailed this to me. On page 15 it states  if a disabled person can't ride regular transit due to regular bus stops being too far from their place based on their mobility assessment, they are eligible to ride on CTA. https://t.co/Yzr9y9OFCa
@calgarytransit @cityofcalgary
@calgarytransit @nenshi @DruhFarrell @gccarra @seanchucalgary @CouncillorKeats @RundleRay it cost taxpayers more $ to operate CTA rides than it does to operate Calgary Transit. That is why I think transit routes should be reduced, but not cancelled.

@calgarytransit In the last few months, there was rollover for the low income bus passes. Will that be happening again for June, or will a June bus pass be needed?
@calgarytransit Thanks for heads up
@calgarytransit are we going back to the original seating capacity on our buses? I just had a over capacity bus drive by me.
@calgarytransit @nenshi @DruhFarrell @gccarra @seanchucalgary @CouncillorKeats @RundleRay I don't normally catch the buses that are affected. But I know of at least 4 people including 2 support workers and 2 disabled people who normally ride 117 Mackenzie town express to work at Superstore. They are now riding CTA everyday to get to and from their destination.
@calgarytransit Bus 43 . I 2019m not sure how many, but enough to where people were sitting side by side and standing in the middle and back entrance
@calgarytransit @nenshi @DruhFarrell @gccarra @seanchucalgary @CouncillorKeats @RundleRay Because CTA only allows up to 2 people in their vehicles due to Covid 19  4 vehicles are used in total to transport the workers and their clients to and from their destination. https://t.co/cLijfN3AJF

@calgarytransit Yes, that 2019s correct.  There wasn 2019t a sign there to give a stop #.  The post is about 18 201d out of the ground bent over.
@calgarytransit Thanx....ya 2019ll have a gooder too
@calgarytransit   Bus rte.93. Bus # 7766. From 45 st lrt to Richmond and Stewart driver constantly and I mean constantly talking to passenger, looking in mirror at her instead of concentrating on driving.  Very unprofessional let alone unsafe driving.
@calgarytransit The ticket machines at the north end of Somerset are declining both me and my friends card which have sufficient funds.
@calgarytransit The ticket machines aren't accepting debt cards at Somerset-Bridlewood at the north end of the plaftform.
Best driver I have had since Mar 15!!! Thank you @calgarytransit bus #6056 MP He is very informative, hilarious and super friendly!! Can't get better than him  2764 2764 2764
As a result of COVID-19 there will be additional @CalgaryTransit service reductions starting on May 25. You can find the details here: https://t.co/h45OdFztTr
@calgarytransit First time catching this bus. It was downtown beside the Scotiabank I want to say 1:25 ish
@calgarytransit Are we supposed to be getting on the bus through the front again?
@calgarytransit OK the bus I got onto the driver had us go through the front so I wasn't sure if thats what we were supposed to do now
@calgarytransit He wanted us to show our passes or tickets im on the 23 at bus stop 8280. I got on at 220 pm
@calgarytransit For sure. It was just odd for him to have us go in though the front. Thought maybe the policy changed
@calgarytransit Does the regular monthly april bus pass still valid today?
Just witnessed 2 buses almost break the crossing bars at chinook station heading east. Bus # 8312 and bus # 8313 @calgarytransit
@calgarytransit your 145 bus driver locked us out of the bus and left at saddle Towne stn and it's pouring rain.
Amazing service during covid in the rain @calgarytransit https://t.co/cLiUC0i7Py
@calgarytransit I've been at the stop at saddletown station since 4:50, He's left the bus locked and there's a group of people soaked out here because there aren't enough shelters.
@calgarytransit Bus number 8244
@calgarytransit He literally locked himself out of the bus and left
@JessicaGenius @calgarytransit It 2019s because people like to ruin it and steal operators shit.
@SimplyCalgarian @calgarytransit Pretty sure it's against policy regardless and a huge dick move when it's raining to disappear for 20 minutes
@calgarytransit The 5:03 did not show up by the way
@JoannePost7 @calgarytransit Y 2019all bitch about customer service and operators not being friendly than do this. You 2019re exactly what 2019s wrong with the system. Get a fucking life bud.
@JessicaGenius @calgarytransit They 2019re allowed to secure the bus when leaving it unattended.
@calgarytransit  hey your machines don 2019t really work in the rain. Hope I don 2019t get caught riding without paying d83d de0a
@SimplyCalgarian @calgarytransit First time I have come across it in a long time, and again, a huge dick move when it's pouring rain. Now the bus is too full for people to sit spaced apart.  d83d dc4c
@CouncillorKeats @calgarytransit These reductions are exciting and positive news for the communities impacted by the noise and air pollution from large empty buses - even pre-covid. #oakridge #route99 #route95 #transitplanningaccountability
Reminder to all Low-Income users of @calgarytransit You need to buy your monthly pass for June ASAP. Especially now, when avoiding the usual queue is crucial because of #COVID19AB Buy online if you are able.

@calgarytransit Are June low income passes valid before the 1st? Because I haven't ordered for the past two months and lost March. Also the day passes and single fares are getting might expensive.

@calgarytransit Thanks  d83d de43
@calgarytransit That's always been the recommendation for general hygiene.
@calgarytransit Thank you for this. Haven't taken the train since beginning of March and am worried about back to work and school in the coming months during rush hour for the kids and I.  I hope that there are more transit 'police' too to address the few but ridiculous riders as well.
@calgarytransit are routes 1 and the Max Purple back to their normal routes? Just got to the stop but it says it should be resuming at 2pm...

@calgarytransit Someone asked me earlier this question. I said I don't know but that I'd ask you on Twitter. Do peace officers still come on board the c-train to check for people's tickets and passes or do they only check them at the city hall station?
@calgarytransit I'm glad they are doing that. I hope they have the mask, sanitizer, and gloves so they stay safe too!
@iceTyyc @cultureyyc Many people on AISH pay $38.15 for @calgarytransit monthly low income bus pass, which some use to ride Calgary Transit Access. According to the city, each CTA trip cost taxpayers $37.00.  Whatever isn't covered by the low income monthly pass, tax payers pay.

@calgarytransit the Trip Planning feature is not working on your website (have tested in 2 different desktop browsers and via mobile). Are you aware of this, or is this part of the new cruelty?
@calgarytransit Can it require that level of sass?

@calgarytransit  201cBased on what we now know about the dynamics of transmission and the pathophysiology of Covid-19, the negative effects of wearing masks outweigh the positive 201d -Dr Antonio Lazzarino of the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at University College London 1/2
@calgarytransit @Dizzarbs Rather than sending by law, why not send social workers.
@calgarytransit For this virus to be so contagious, the main route of transmission must be via the smaller, invisible particles, which are not filtered by surgical masks or scarves or bandanas.  Therefore, trying to block the bigger particles gives a minor protection against the transmission.2/2
@calgarytransit All the mask does for me is make it so I cant breath. Most dont perverted you from getting the virus. Maybe start kicking the crack heads off the trains other then worry about who has a mask on.
@lizablabbit @calgarytransit If that is true I think you should just stay home at all times.

@calgarytransit, it appears someone set a fire of sorts at the Tuscany station 2019s waiting area by the bus loop. There 2019s ash everywhere, and the glass is burnt.

@calgarytransit I can buy my low income bus pass today
@calgarytransit So hard to read the comments of people here man :/
@tracyinkits @calgarytransit Are we still using cotton masks? No, we aren't. They are not effective. If you care for a TB patient they are on airborne precautions, meaning full PPE with and n95 mask that has to fit tested to your face. You yet no protection against the virus with a cloth mask. https://t.co/BG4w3ZORmO
@Flames_Fan1 @tracyinkits @calgarytransit This virus is airborne as argued at https://t.co/FNNEI3zDtf .  https://t.co/4V7MaoZ5w0 80-90% filtration of aerosols by hybrid cloth mask. All masks can filter airborne to some extent.  More mask studies, info, filtration rates, comparisons @ https://t.co/FNNEI3zDtf
@calgarytransit is there any saddletown train coming?
@calgarytransit I forgot to thank you! It only took six years of me trying but you guys finally announce which train is pulling in as it 2019s pulling in! I 2019m so excited for this especially downtown. Now my blind ass probably won 2019t be getting on the wrong train

@calgarytransit Question can the low income pass be delivered?
@calgarytransit  It was so nice to see Heritage station free of people loitering at 6 in the morning
@calgarytransit Thanks.
@calgarytransit the driver of the 7 i got on made me and another passenger get on the front of the bus? we were both waiting for the back doors to open, they didn 2019t, so approached the drivers door to ask them to open it..... 1/2
Congrats @calgarytransit ! It only took a few YEARS, but you finally moved rt. 150 to the right stop. No more being told by drivers at both stops that I was at the wrong one. Maybe some cement pads in another 2-3 years so we dont have to wade thru ankle-deep mud when it rains?
@calgarytransit i caught the bus at the corner of 14th st and 17th ave. it was around 3:30 i 2019m not sure about the exact time, the clock was not flashing on the bus.
@calgarytransit uhm, towards south calgary, not downtown. i don 2019t know n/s
@calgarytransit I wear it to feel safe and protect others around me
@calgarytransit again the little things, I understand the need for #COVID19 precautions but I would like to point out when you are in a #wheelchair the back door entry to #Calgary transit is not #accessible everyone #StayHealthy #YYC

@calgarytransit I wear a mask because I want to stop the spread, as well i want every doctor, nurse, grocery store worker, transit operator, etc.. get back to their home safe and can have family time as i do. They deserve, all of us do deserve...

@calgarytransit Why do we need to give single ride ticket if the drivers wouldn 2019t give transfer pass? So if we need to ride more than 1 bus we need to give 2 tickets? Which will cost $7??
@calgarytransit And it is not ideal for people who works only few hrs a week to buy a monthly pass either. Is it ok to just pay with coins??
@calgarytransit How will I validate if I don 2019t ride ctrain?
@calgarytransit Ok. I 2019ll see if other driver will accept that. Thanks.
@calgarytransit I wear mask most of time when I run errands outside. Just to keep myself safe and others around you. It 2019s best and highly recommending to wear masks.
@calgarytransit where can I get my low income pass? I cannot get it online because I only have cash. Or is the march pass going to be good for June as well?
@calgarytransit Good morning my friends how 2019s it going?
@calgarytransit I discovered when I have my mask on it helps me to social distance and to remember to use hand sanitizer https://t.co/vMflAsZoop
@calgarytransit Oh yes great weather I am heading out of town with a friend today I certainly will have a great day. And you has well have a great day.
@calgarytransit We are in the same household @KiraArtist
@calgarytransit Morning.  Why is there so many empty buses moving along 24st. SE.  between 114 ave and deer foot trail? This starts at 4am and continues all day.  If the cycle time for the run is every 30 mins, then the drivers must be leaving each stop early.  Route 92 , 96,150.
@calgarytransit Would be nice if my bus drivers and the cleaning staff were wearing them/wearing them properly.
@calgarytransit I was on the bus Monday and I was the only one that showed my bus pass and everyone got on and off the bus without showing anything. So how is this working? By the honour system? I bought a pass for June by why if none is showing payment?
@calgarytransit The westbound #153 bus reached stop 9616 at 7:43 today and I was told earlier this week that it was due at 7:50. Please tell your drivers that being early may mean up to an additional 30 minute wait for passengers. It has happened to me earlier this week.
@calgarytransit Hopefully when the budget cuts happen social media staff and fake surveys will be the first thing to go.
@calgarytransit I wear a mask at work. It keeps others safe, slightly reduces my exposure and helps spread the message that we can beat this virus if we stay vigilant with our new routines. (sanitizing, mask handling, hand washing, etc.) Stay safe, smart and strong #yyc
@calgarytransit I wear a mask as a sign of respect to those around me.
@calgarytransit There also nothing if they need to pay cash or need a transfer. It 2019s looks like it free and I should do it because everyone else is, I 2019m not but guessing people are thinking that. I thanked my bus drivers some are nice and other grumpy. I get it it 2019s strange times.
@calgarytransit Enough.  We get it.
@calgarytransit I wear one when I go to the grocery store. I 2019ll be taking @calgarytransit for the first time in 10 week on Monday and I 2019ll wear one then too. Even though as far as I know I 2019m not sick it protects front line workers who risk their health everyday
hey @calgarytransit how can bus riders pay with tickets? I 2019ve been trying to find information online but couldn 2019t find what i was looking for.
@calgarytransit Studies are showing wearing masks are worse than not. You tend to touch your face more, no body wears them right and they don 2019t protect anything.
@calgarytransit Unfortunately not everyone will be doing the honourable thing. But thanks again for your quick response to my question
@calgarytransit can riders rind the bell when their stop is approaching?
@Crackmacs @calgarytransit Agreed.I have been able to reduce my use of CT a lot since the pandemic hit but the dozen or so times I have had to, only one driver was wearing a mask and that was pre rear door boarding.  If CT is going to preach to us about it they should practice what they preach.
@calgarytransit So are you going to be providing us with masks then?

@CageYYC @JyotiGondek Absolutely right - @calgarytransit should retire their old LRT cars. With updated vehicles, transit will be more appealing, more people will take it, better value for taxpayer dollars, etc.
@HealthierYou17 @calgarytransit Ahh yes, the study in  201cModern Incel 201d magazine. That 2019s the one you mean, right??

@calgarytransit On Barlow near small roundabout, buss is currently on 36th St south of Memorial
@Laellon @calgarytransit Has this driver informed control of his overload situation ?
@janedoughnut @calgarytransit Or pay on your phone.  Why are we so far behind?  Cost them for sure!
@Flames_Fan1 @calgarytransit I said 100 yrs ago.  Do you have difficulty reading? Of course us healthcare workers wear medical grade masks on duty.  Off duty, we wear whatever mask, bandana, scarf you can find if you are not able to safe distance. A cotton mask is better than no mask.

@Flames_Fan1 @calgarytransit Well when your on a bus your not exactly performing a tracheostomy, risk of a high viral load is unlikely, unless your on #1. Wearing a cotton mask, will suffice in protection from asymptomatic carriers who get too close, sneeze, spit, eat or have poor hygenic behaviour on board.
@Flames_Fan1 @calgarytransit PS Your point was you stated masks arent necessary, trap germs &amp; contribute to litter. Read your 1st post again. Wrong on all counts. Necessary: Distancing is not always attainable on a bus. 2: Hold Germs. No they minimize exposure to such. 3.Litter:Cotton washables aren't tossed
@Crackmacs @calgarytransit @nenshi @PetRecoveryYYC Do we know if she was found?
@alainenoel @Crackmacs @calgarytransit @nenshi Yes she was
@calgarytransit Maybe if you had shut it down when Edmonton did, you wouldn't be begging people to keep you in service. You're low ridership was due to the pandemic. Ya got that, right?This is exactly why you're in this position now.  Smh
@calgarytransit what's going on with route 99? Yesterday and today it was 10+ min late. I'm at stop 4243.
Hey @calgarytransit I'm at bus stop #2488 why did the 99 bus stop here? Is there a detour?
@calgarytransit I wear the mask but if Calgary transit is asking us to wear a mask I feel all Calgary transit operators should follow the same advice. I have seen maybe 2 drivers with mask 2019s.
@calgarytransit This is a disturbing gif - can you please stop using it.
@robintyler36 @calgarytransit I came here to say just this.  This spammy campaign is very hypocritical.  When I take the bus, I wear a mask toprotect the driver and my fellow passengers.  To bad the drivers don 2019t reciprocate. Guess passengers really don 2019t matter.

@jfiliatrault Try @calgarytransit 2 out of 31 people wearing masks the other morning on my train car (&amp; I was 1 of the 2.) You cannot safely distance with 31 people on a car either.
@calgarytransit is that George Floyd ?
@calgarytransit No thank you. I have not seen a single worker sanitizing the escalator handrails.
@calgarytransit Why are you removing the  201cDo not sit here 201d stickers on the bus seats? It 2019s hard to respect the 2 m distancing when more and more people are starting to use transit again and things are getting crowded. If anything, more signage is needed to enforce it, not less.

@calgarytransit Will it be mandatory to wear a mask to ride on your buses and trains?
@calgarytransit Ok wait, so what if I had to transit to the other side of the city that required 3 different buses. I 2019d have to pay 3x rather than once because you aren 2019t giving out transfers?
@calgarytransit why aren 2019t any trains going from Southland to downtown???? They 2019re all heritage all day

@calgarytransit 755 Lake Bonavista Dr SE. Stops 6061/6058. I 2019m not sure when they arrived, because I didn 2019t want to sit in the sun for 45 minutes. But the 29 was scheduled for 6:44 and the 35 was scheduled for 6:43. It just makes getting to and from work incredibly difficult.

@djdevo79 @calgarytransit Interesting response...They probably should wear masks, but why do you need to wait for them to do it first? Do you also loiter and say "I will stop loitering when my neighbours stop"?
@calgarytransit Are rush hour bike rules still in effect during COVID?
I don 2019t even bother with @calgarytransit anymore, because they just tell me it 2019s my fault - for using the app, for being at the busy stop early but not early enough, for running after the bus that was early.  We 2019re in the middle of a trying time, but none of these issues are new.
@calgarytransit I wear a mask to protect the drivers and my fellow passengers. When can I expect drivers to do the same.  Funnily enough, you post this often and never respond to this point about drivers.
@calgarytransit Not an incident, and not as dramatic as I make it out to be when I 2019m frustrated and getting soaked. I was at a bus stop several minutes early and waiting when I saw the app counter flip from 6 to 4 to 3 to 0 the 42. And I 2019m in an Uber now.
@calgarytransit  thank you for bringing me from home to work everyday and keeping our transit system worry-less to ride during the Local State of Emergency. Now another month is about to enter! #Covid19 #Calgaryatitsbest #EssentialWorkers https://t.co/tk6Y807BnS
@calgarytransit #65 Market Mall stop at Charleswood &amp; Brentwood mall. The app said 6 minutes.
@calgarytransit I know what the issue is: the app doesn 2019t match the bus 2019s progress. I know it can 2019t be perfect, but it should be close when the only option is a bus that runs every 40 minutes. In this case, 42.
@calgarytransit @gimli_cat Calgary Transit Why do you promote the use of face masks if you not setting an example...please.
@calgarytransit That means nothing.  I have seen one driver wearing a mask this whole time. If you aren 2019t going to practice what you preach, stop preaching. The hypocrisy is unacceptable.
@calgarytransit @Mickey_Kelly The app is so buggy. They have been using the same excuses since I worked out in Heritage Gate 2 years ago.
@Mickey_Kelly @calgarytransit This has been my experience for 22 years.
@calgarytransit I am officially back to work tomorrow.  I just realized I didn't buy a bus pass or tickets.  How do I pay in the morning???
@calgarytransit Thanks. I was going to run to Shell but its raining so bad!!!  I've bussed my whole life, just wasn't sure if I was allowed to pay cash yet.
@calgarytransit No idea. 65 Market Mall doesn 2019t follow a fixed schedule so I was just watching the app. Charles Woodson/Brentwood stop sometime around 5:30.

@calgarytransit I have a real problem with the amount of transit drivers that blow through stops early so they can sit at a time stop and use their cell phones for personal use . Happens too often on my routes particularly 3,93, 36/41. Routes I use regularly.

@calgarytransit I know it's of limited effectiveness in protecting me from the virus directly, but I kind of hope the fact I'm wearing one keeps the un-masked a safe distance away by their thinking I'm sick.  Also, it has bunnies on it.
@calgarytransit Have you asked the provincial government if you could give them out?  Do it publicly here, now.  Since people taking transit most likely do not have a car to get to drive-through  fast food joints for some.     Earn your fares.

@calgarytransit FYI. Looks like some of your buses are not sanitized. This was at 6:40am today Anderson Station bus 92 https://t.co/HAkbR6uXYR
@calgarytransit Hi, I have not purchased the June Monthly Pass yet, what can I use as fare for the meantime as I know cash is not accepted yet? Thank you.
@calgarytransit Thank you. I will do that for now...
@tracyinkits @calgarytransit But now that more people are going back, when will schedules resume as well?
@calgarytransit @tracyinkits @calgarytransit funny not 12 hours ago you acknowledge the INCREASE of ridership again, but I don 2019t see any service increase or activation yet. Hmmm easy enough to make it hard for riders, but hard to make it easier?
@calgarytransit @tracyinkits https://t.co/wJ4UrcNTTg
@calgarytransit About a month after COVID 19 hit the city I emailed the director of CTA,  AJ Ryland to ask him what they are doing to keep riders and drivers safe. He answered me right away about that thus reassuring me he cares about everyone safety.
@GlobalCalgary @nenshi As ridership increases on Calgary Transit Access and Calgary Transit with the reopening of businesses what are you and @calgarytransit doing to keep everyone on board safe? Are you providing mask for those people who don 2019t have 1? https://t.co/R3q4SGPdwL  #PhysicalDistancing
What is @calgarytransit policy on carrying refundable recycled material on the bus? I was told  for the amount I was carrying I could be refused access to the bus.
@calgarytransit this happened last night. the guy with his pants down started masterbating while making comments at me. not something I want to deal with after work, or ever. clean up your trains. do checks. I had nobody to go to. https://t.co/xavw2tZ7LD
@calgarytransit hey heads up, a man on car 2271 heading west from Shaganappi station just pulled a boxcutter on another passenger. I got off along with the passenger, but the other guy is still on the train
@calgarytransit The passenger was still on the platform when I left, he might have been calling it in. The other guy had dark skin, black baseball cap and sunglasses with a grey-ish t-shirt. Headphones and I think he was wearing work boots
@calgarytransit Just make transit free

@calgarytransit so had to get off small bus 1331 route 147. No  201cno sitting 201d signs on any seat and the driver stopped at a stop that 2019s had 10+ more people getting on so I had to get off to be safe. Now I have to walk the 15 stops to 39 ave train station. Thanks
@calgarytransit Like 10 minutes ago at the stop on 42 ave SE outside the casino
@calgarytransit Are any trains running in the core? 10 mins waiting at 1st Street station and nothing either way.

@calgarytransit Going back to the office on Monday. Looking on the website for info on how the board the bus. I can 2019t find anything.
@calgarytransit I haven't taken transit since March, is it free during this time or do I need a pass or coins to pay??
@calgarytransit Understood, thank you!
@calgarytransit Is there any word on when we'll be needing to get new monthly bus passes as the city reopens?
@calgarytransit I asked this a few days ago but I'll ask it again, what IS being done to "make it easier"?
@calgarytransit what happened to the Sunnyside 104 that leaves stop 5771 at 3:19? Didn 2019t show up and it says the next one is 3:49
@calgarytransit Well...that doesn't make things easier. Because there are people out shopping all the time lately; there was a big protest yesterday and I didn't see any social distancing. Making things "easier" would be reducing the fee when you KNOW people have been laid off or cut hours.
@calgarytransit I mean, I work in a pharmacy and it gets pretty busy in there customer wise. But I also haven't worked 40 hours since this situation began, so how does what you're doing make things easier to me when I'm not making money like I used to? Social distancing? Try harder.
@calgarytransit When wasn't in effect? I wasn't disputing that, but I was wondering what you're doing for people who aren't making as much money as they were at the start of the year. All this looks like an attempt to sound like you're doing something when you're not.
@calgarytransit there is a young man requesting to use co-riders' phones to call the police. Now, he is spitting on the floor of the train. 2335, second coach...just headed towards Bridgeland from City hall
@calgarytransit He is wearing black sun glasses, camo pants and just got off at Rundle
@calgarytransit are passengers supposed to be  201cflashing 201d our tickets or passes to drivers when we get on the buses now?  I have no issues paying - some drivers just say no, but others are adimant I show my pass #confused

So im confused @calgarytransit tou app says no 444 for 50 mins  but ur website says there is one at 7:07.  Stop  3571 i looked at the app @ 6:56 am https://t.co/Tcmx0IpVBr
@calgarytransit I mean, if we 2019re working 5 days a week, it 2019s more expensive to buy the tickets. This month hurt, though. I have to walk 2.2km to the train on weekends after a full shift on my feet because it 2019s faster than waiting 45 minutes for BOTH buses that show up outside my work.
@calgarytransit Is there a reason why the driver on the 302 was only asking black people for proof of payment. I wasn't asked, and the next white people after that black woman got on, were not asked. Seems like a discriminatory policy.
@calgarytransit SB train is stopped at Anderson, no announcement from the operator. What has us delayed? #yyc
@calgarytransit I am waiting at stop 8974 for a Route 20 Northmount.  It was supposed to arrive at 8:47.  Someone else waiting at the stop said it went by early.  Now I am going to be late for my appointment.
@calgarytransit I arrived on the Route 105 about 5 minutes before the 20 was due.  About 8:42 or so.  The Route 20 just arrived now at 9:00.  Bus 7844.
@calgarytransit 9:06 am - arrived at stop 5779 on the 20 Northmount.  Driver gets out to smoke a cigar.  App says we should have left when we got here.  9:09 and we are finally moving.
@calgarytransit @nenshi So what about the folks that need to board at the front because of mobility issues ? What protects them ?  The hypocrisy is strong with this.  It 2019s also a very confined space with limited ventilation. If someone is ill that could spread through the entire vehicle.
@calgarytransit @nenshi It 2019s still hypocritical to keep spamming twitter with this when the drivers aren 2019t required to protect us from them. Spin it any way you want, it is still hypocritical.

@DruhFarrell @jvipondmd @nenshi @doniveson @iceTyyc @erinchrusch @gccarra @EWoolleyWard8 @calgarytransit We just got back from the market and we were some of the only ones wearing masks. C 2019mon, Calgary!   Crossroads Market even has a mask vendor when you first walk in.

@Calgaryfares @MezaunEvin It would be good to ask transit riders who live along the affected cancelled routes on  this question and invite them to the discussion.  https://t.co/pDo9EVEMx0 @BeddingtonCA @mypanoramahills @Tuscany_Calgary @calgarytransit @Cedarbraeinfo
I hope that what @tylershandro said comes true. That they will be giving mask to places like @calgarytransit on top of what they are giving to the various restaurants, so that transit users who don't have cars, can still get free mask too.   https://t.co/bE0KQKN35i
@calgarytransit I'm glad you guys have setup the texting number and actively respond to it, however you guys really should add it to your description so people don't have to hunt through your tweets to find the number. https://t.co/yEvEP3ZftA
@calgarytransit Hey, what is the policy with bus passes for June? I was just told I may not be allowed to use the Low Income March bus pass.
Hi @calgarytransit Are you excepting coins for fares on buses? I cannot find the info on the website or in your social feed thank you
@calgarytransit Thanks for the info. Have a good one.
@calgarytransit @RuthMylesCH So does that mean if I am getting on a bus to go the the ctrain but only have coin that they will let me on free of charge till I can purchase at the train  station?
@icecreamanarchy @DruhFarrell @jvipondmd @nenshi @doniveson @iceTyyc @erinchrusch @gccarra @EWoolleyWard8 @calgarytransit Stay at home then forever
@calgarytransit Bus 29 is supposedly showing up to stop 6061 25 minutes late. It was supposed to show up at 1:45, and according to another rider who 2019s tracking the bus, it 2019s just sitting there. It 2019s getting pretty ridiculous to have to wait an hour just to get a bus home.
@mikesbloggity @DruhFarrell @jvipondmd @nenshi @doniveson @iceTyyc @erinchrusch @gccarra @EWoolleyWard8 @calgarytransit Totally!
@DruhFarrell @jvipondmd @nenshi @doniveson @iceTyyc @erinchrusch @gccarra @EWoolleyWard8 @calgarytransit Masks are optional in public. If it were essential then you would think govt would create some enforceable rules.

@lourdesmjuan @gccarra @DruhFarrell @jvipondmd @nenshi @doniveson @iceTyyc @erinchrusch @EWoolleyWard8 @calgarytransit Sadly, I found the same at the new Urban Fare on 8th last week. Myself &amp; our little one were the only one's in masks. Physical distancing by shoppers &amp; staff was non existant as well. It's a choice to wear a mask but at a min we should all try to physical distance when possible.
@RuthMylesCH @calgarytransit they laugh at people that contact them this way just call or email them
@RuthMylesCH @calgarytransit they need your credit card # as it contains your name they  need to collect that data

@calgarytransit Your phone service indicates next #153 westbound is due at #9616 at 7:50 am. That has not been my experience during last 2 weeks - has the schedule changed?
@calgarytransit route 120 is scheduled to stop at NB Silvergrove and Silver Springs Rise at 7:50, why is the next real-time bus say 8:30?
@calgarytransit I phoned at 7:23 and it told me the next bus was in 27 minutes - I make that 7:50. Past experience tells me it reaches that stop at 7:43. I 2019ve missed the bus twice and had to wait &gt;30 minutes

@calgarytransit is there anywhere open I can purchase a June month pass? Like city hall?
@calgarytransit would be nice if a bus was going to sit at a stop for 10-15 minutes for it to go out of service. Otherwise I would have jumped on the other 301 and be en route instead of just sitting at North Point depot. #somuchforbeingearly

@calgarytransit @cityofcalgary @CityofEdmonton @SAF_YEG @Actionhall @nenshi @DruhFarrell @gccarra If the mask is already on @cityofcalgary property.

@calgarytransit It looks like someone knocked over the stop for the 43, EB 58 Ave SE/Burbank Rd. The drivers don 2019t always stop now. Can we get it replaced pleaee?
@calgarytransit pretty blatant crack smoking in the shelter at Chinook Station.....
@calgarytransit Hello,  the buses 147 are small busses and they are leaving people standing on the bus stops because they  can't take more people, maybe could be a better idea to have the regular busses running in this area .
@calgarytransit  d83d dc4d d83c dffc
@calgarytransit your driver making me feel like I am breaking the law because I dont have a pass. Asking where i am going. Its none of his business. I have tickets and have paid daily since this all has started.
@calgarytransit Just got on the 44. Bus 1258. I get hes doing his job but asking me where I am going is wrong. If transit wants to enforce payment have someone at each station asking.
@Hame1DM2020 @calgarytransit Wish they did that more often. I have sometimes asked bus drivers to do this and they have told me they could not. :-( Donna, you got lucky.
@calgarytransit Good morning to you as well beautiful picture.
@calgarytransit speaking for a few friends and as a concerned resident Can you explain why the last stop time for the 169 Rocky ridge is 8:40 ish. This is ridiculous you have several people this route effects who have to work at the coop there which closes at 10pm.
@calgarytransit any chance someone could ACTUALLY help me here? I ordered a bus pass online through the Fair Entry program. I received a Youth Pass. I asked to exchange and you expect me to go all the way downtown to get another. This was not my mistake, all I want is an exchange
@calgarytransit Ya, I've already called. They told me what I JUST tweeted you.
@calgarytransit thank you. hopefully they agree.
@calgarytransit is the costumer service at 3rd St open today?

@calgarytransit @springcanadian1 @cityofcalgary @CityofEdmonton @SAF_YEG @Actionhall I think you owe @springcanadian1 an apology Calgary Transit. She was right.

I hope you guys give the mask to your riders on Calgary transit and Calgary transit access.   @nenshi @DruhFarrell @gccarra
@kathymarasco @calgarytransit that's awesome!
@calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow I know they won't last long. It may be good to give them based on who is at highest risk of not being able to heal from covid 19 seniors, people in poverty and disabled riders
@calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow Maybe it would be good to prioritize who gets it based on who's at highest risk of not being able to heal from getting covid 19.  Disabled riders on Calgary transit access  Riders who get the low income bus pass  Seniors who get the seniors and low income seniors pass.
@calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow If there is any mask left after that, they should be given to the public upon request.  These are just suggestions.
@calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow You're welcome
@calgarytransit Thanks! Have a great day ;)
@calgarytransit So I called again. You can't do anything. Big surprise. Your customer service people are also very rude.
@calgarytransit Are the vending machines accepting cash? Yesterday tried to insert coins and machine returned them all
@calgarytransit Middle machine at EB 6th street SW station, thank you!
@calgarytransit hi! Is it still the honour system of ripping tickets or is it back to business and I need to get a transfer from the driver?
@calgarytransit Thank you And are the seats still distancing w stickers? I was on a 1 about a week and a half ago and there were no seat stickers but I saw a 1 going opposite direction and it had the seat stickers. It was busy and set off a bit of anxiety in me as everyone sat where they wanted.

@calgarytransit Oh really? We can buy it online? What happens when they send you the wrong bus pass? You get told too bad our mistake. Go downtown during a pandemic when you can barely afford the pass in the first place. "fair entry"...uh huh

Hey @calgarytransit why is there no physical distancing on CTrains. Very scary to ride. You should require riders at least to mask up. What do you think @CBCEyeopener @CBCHomestretch @nenshi  Just saying. My wife will not ride transit. It is NOT SAFE!
@BikeBikeYYC The poors have to get them on the bus somehow, @calgarytransit is getting a shipment
@calgarytransit What I am struggling with is buying low income passes. I can't get to the 3 - 4 places that sell them. Credit card is maxed due to covid. CALGON TAKE ME AWAY!  d83d de02
@calgarytransit @NStebanuk The 3 carts are getting pretty full in the morning. Be much better idea just to do it now.
@paddysbrewbecue @calgarytransit @CBCEyeopener @CBCHomestretch @nenshi They're losing so much money, I don't think they can afford to have personal policing social distancing and mask wearing. They've been recommending both since COVID began here.
@springcanadian1 @calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow So riders who pay for the low income passes are at high risk of covid?!? Someone 2019s income doesn 2019t not affect who gets covid and who doesn 2019t
@DidyDidycuz @calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow People living in  poverty are at higher risk of getting COVID 19 because they don't have enough money to get the food and supplies they need to stay safe and healthy. https://t.co/wKu4PxrK47  https://t.co/QEH0sHLFpn
@DidyDidycuz @calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow People in Calgary who have a higher income, than those who get the low income bus pass can afford to do things like: -buy groceries -drive a car thru McDonalds, Tim Hortons, or  A &amp; W to get the mask @youralberta has provided. -buy hand sanitzer and lysol wipes -pay rent on time
@DidyDidycuz @calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow @YourAlberta when people can afford to eat healthy food, get a mask, buy disinfectant and hand sanitizers (as well as soap), and pay rent on time, they have a better chance of being able to heal from COVID 19.   People who get the low income bus pass can't afford those things without help.
@DidyDidycuz @calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow @YourAlberta when we the people in poverty don't get the help they need to stay healthy, everyone ends up at risk.  That is why I mentioned a priority system to Calgary Transit. They don't have enough mask to give to everyone who rides with them.
@DidyDidycuz @calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow @YourAlberta By helping the people in poverty and people in other vulnerable groups get the mask, there is a chance we can stop the spread of COVID 19 or at least lessen the impact of it in society.  Calgary transit can't provide people in poverty a home to self isolate.
@DidyDidycuz @calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @DisabilityAB @CPAlberta @mirkbrow @YourAlberta But what Calgary Transit can do is help people in poverty stop spreading Covid 19 to other people by offering them the opportunity to wear the mask.  https://t.co/qNX3YT2sl4
@TheDaveCA @NStebanuk @calgarytransit On one hand I agree with you. There needs to be more people on board to justify the cost of running the 4 car c-train, but on the other hand having 4 car trains now would help with physical distancing especially during rush hour.

@calgarytransit With less capacity per bus due to social distancing, you need to run more or larger buses on busy routes, such as the northbound 43 in the afternoon rush. Watching multiple buses with no capacity go by is very frustrating.
Hi @calgarytransit is something going on with the 22 lately? I usually catch the 4:25pm toward city centre at stop 8651. On Wed it was 15 minutes late. Today the app says it will be 15 minutes late again. Also - any news on going back to full schedules?? Thank you!

@calgarytransit And the Transit App messes up again.  I asked for a trip plan this morning and it gave me one.  Now the second bus doesn't exist at the time it gave me and I will be half hour late for work
@calgarytransit The app told me to catch the 9-Chinook to the University arriving at 8:14am.  I did that.  Then it said to wait for the 20-Northmount at 8:40am.  But now it says the 20 only runs hourly.
@calgarytransit I would very much appreciate a response in this issue.  I am late for work because of it.  New job.  Rely on Transit to get me there.  I want to know why it gave me a bus time that doesn 2019t exist.

@calgarytransit Can you tell me how often #65 runs on weekends? The app says the next bus is 55 minutes away. That cannot possibly be right.
@calgarytransit #3986 It just showed up, even though the app said it wouldn 2019t be here for another 50 min.
@calgarytransit 1/. I know I complain a lot and may be written off as a crank and I 2019m sorry. But, like tens of thousands of Calgarians, I absolutely depend on CT.  The price of my bus pass keeps going up and the service I 2019m paying for keeps going down. That 2019s insane.
@calgarytransit 2/. Route 65 was ntroduced to replace 22, 122, 407, and nearby 9, 10. We lost all those options, and now the wait between 65s is 40+ minutes. And the app has an alert that says the wait will be 45 minutes from now on.
@calgarytransit 3/  it is simply wrong for the Coty and CT to ask Calgarians to drive less and take the bus if there is no bus or adequate bus service. When we pay for a ticket or bus pass, we want to ride a bus. Not be taken for a ride or thrown under the bus.
@calgarytransit Maybe, if we could get free Uber when we show a valid bus pass?
@calgarytransit The impact is painful and negative and there is no reasonable expectation it won 2019t continue to get worse because CT has been gaslighting is with the same script for years. Can we petition to replace the route 65 and get the other routes back?
@calgarytransit Sorry for my snark, but what you 2019re saying, basically, is  201csucks to be you. Go buy a car. 201c Not you, personally.  Whoever prepared the response we keep hearing.

@calgarytransit Thanks. I don 2019t have much faith in the system, but I 2019ll try. I know it sounds petty, but people like me who do not drive don 2019t have a lot of choices when It comes to appointments or groceries or anything like that.

@calgarytransit Please make masks mandatory on public transit ..like Ontario has
@calgarytransit Why don 2019t all the buses have bike racks, at least the ones on major routes like the 1?
@calgarytransit how do you perpose we should keep distance on Blue line when there is always 16 mins or late ( always) service of blue line and people take risk because next train isn't behind it's 16 mins after. Work on your schedule please.
@calgarytransit That's not concern where I catch the bus on blue Line I  am talking about keeping distance in Blue line when there is lot of passanger waiting due to train running every 16 mins, if you going to keep 16 mins service than add 4th car on lrt so we can keep a distance
@calgarytransit had an issue with the route 32 Huntington driver bus 8251.  The driver refused to open the front doors to let my husband on with a stroller then refused to let anyone else on if there were no available seats. A passenger was nice enough to get off so my husband

@calgarytransit wondering what the procedure is when you cannot board the bus when it's at capacity? The driver looked like he was calling for another bus - I'm not sure what this means for us being left behind.
@calgarytransit I'm at stop 6013. There was a person here who was denied on the previous bus. The bus is every 30 min.
@calgarytransit @bleedthemelody Are they increasing in frequency now that they are half capacity or will the city be reducing the cost of transit to compensate?

@calgarytransit @Paulovincenzom1 Why are adult monthly passes not transferable?  Where is this indicated in the bylaw?  A single trip ticket/transfer, or discounted/qualified fare (low income, senior, student, etc) would not be transferable, but a full price monthly (adult or child) seems to be transferable.
@calgarytransit the driver of route 120 on bus 1213 demanded a rider 2019s ticket and instead of a transfer said to write down the bus number and have a peace officer call him if she got stopped (1/2)
@calgarytransit @Paulovincenzom1 Maybe my reading skills are failing me, can you point out where? https://t.co/PmjNlbV4BI
@calgarytransit if I get a train ticket online do I need to print it off? Or do I just show it on my phone
@calgarytransit This was about 10 min ago in between Dalhousie heading towards crowfoot
@calgarytransit @Paulovincenzom1 A quick read of bylaw 4M81 makes it clear:   10. (1) No person shall sell, exchange or give away a transfer, validated ticket or non- transferable ticket.  Regular adult and youth passes are transferable since they are not indicated to be not transferable.
@calgarytransit @Paulovincenzom1 If I 2019m wrong, please let me know what I missed that would make full fare monthly passes non-transferable?

@k_mitch22 @calgarytransit her masks and we take her shopping as much as possible. She is totally alone.  No kids.  Widowed.  Lots of people like her with nobody to help. Living in a fixed income. How about them ?  They count too.
@k_mitch22 @calgarytransit I took personal responsibility.  You attacked me without knowing anything about me or why I made my comment.  Do better.  Be a better human.
@k_mitch22 @calgarytransit Oh, it 2019s also a PROVINCIAL thing.  The city is just delivering them.

@k_mitch22 @calgarytransit You seem to have reading comprehension  issues.  I supply my own masks.  I even help others. Seniors and disabled people live on a very low income. They count too though.
@k_mitch22 @calgarytransit Some people are luckier than others.  Some people are not capable of working anymore or never were.  Does that mean they are less important ?  Wait until you are a senior and alone in the world.  Remember this conversation and how judgemental you were.  Karma is a thing.

@calgarytransit Your drivers should never be aloud to refuse service to someone with a bike in the pouring rain. ESPECIALLY when the bus is LITERALLY EMPTY. Bus stop 8419 Route 301 North @ 10:00PM I am cold, wet, I just want to go home, driver opened his door and closed it on me.
@calgarytransit do you if a person can submit a resume for transit operator. I know you have a hiring freeze on right now.
@calgarytransit What request? I never requested anything? If you want me to have a request, I request that your drivers have a bit more empathy and compassion when it comes to the small amount of people left riding transit.
@calgarytransit Please make mask mandatory in transit

@fuunkyfresh @calgarytransit Also...like, had they lived up to what they promised YEARS back, there'd have been a bike rack on that first bus so you wouldn't have even had to be chastised by a driver.  https://t.co/9DhI5DopPA

@calgarytransit can you let drivers of the #17 know that 23rd ave between Spiller Road and 9th street SE is getting a speed reduction to 30km/h for a detour. @yyctransport
Good move @calgarytransit! Well done! I was wondering how you were going to protect drivers from passengers  with disabilities, and visa versa when the passengers need to use the front door to enter and exit the bus safely. https://t.co/jmfylTbvIo
@calgarytransit @nenshi This is interesting as the university is telling us the opposite. That it is Calgary Transit that made the decision and not the university. That they had no influence on the decision. Who should we trust?
@calgarytransit @nenshi It is unfortunate all round. The withdrawal of the UPASS was not well communicated all round. @ucalgary did a poor job of notifying students of the change and many still are unaware of the change. If I didn't read all the way through a newsletter, i wouldn't have known about it.

@calgarytransit Oh, none of the drivers have told me that. Though I don't ride that often
@myworldtaw @calgarytransit A Decade ago they built this leg of LRT laid rail, built stations in one year, serving 100k commuters. I was amazed how fast it all came together, and runs at 80km/hr hot or cold or snow storms even the big Flood 2013, Track washed out, was rebuilt fast. https://t.co/tFwXX9eMwu

@calgarytransit bus driver on bus 6044 listening to very angry Men yelling in a foreign language recordings while driving the bus. Not very comfortable on the max purple right now. Asked him to turn down was ignored. He needs to turn that off.

@calgarytransit Thank you so much.
@calgarytransit Good evening how are you guys doing?
@calgarytransit I'm doing awesome thanks for asking um I have one concern
@calgarytransit I'm wondering why the route 46 is 38 minutes late
@calgarytransit 10:19 at the 78 Avenue terminal
@calgarytransit Stop number 5579
@calgarytransit hi! Are you guys starting to take fares/passes now? My 16 y/o sister was yelled at by your #38 driver today, stating that she NEEDS to show proof of fair, or leave..sense when was this ok?! She had fare, but the verbal attack is NOT required.
@calgarytransit Okay thanks
@calgarytransit How do we even pay on the bus? Last time I used one, the driver got me to use the rear door and I didn't see where to pay. I ended up paying at the c train station .
@calgarytransit Not quite sure the stop #, but it is by Annie Foote school - 38 Brentwood @ 8pm tonight. Can you clarify if this is required? She was able to board via the back, but was required to still show proof..just want to be prepared for next time so she doesn 2019t get put on the spot.
@calgarytransit gonna need some pretty significant fare increases to pay for that $10 billion Green line.
@calgarytransit Might want to tell drivers of your community shuttles small buses. They're asking for fares to be put in the fare box. Which is great and all unless the passenger is continuing on with another bus/train. Twice this past week I saw people upset when they could not get a transfer.
@calgarytransit I know we are still required to pay..are we required to show the ticket/pass when boarding is my question. I know the  201chonour system  201c was in place, I am just clarifying if that is still the case, I didn 2019t see anything regarding that.
@calgarytransit @yyctransport Can we re-pass this info along. The buses aren 2019t adhering to the lowered speed.
@RBcochrane @calgarytransit Calgary Transit didn't think these matters through in advance.

Hey @calgarytransit can you explain why my bus just drove past my stop??? With me frantically waving my arms as he kept going past me??? Route #78 at stop #8248. Can you ask him to kindly stop next time?? I'll be here, still waiting.
@calgarytransit It was route #78 at stop #8248. It just happened and no, I was not just approaching the stop. I had been standing at the stop for 6 minutes prior. I watched him not slow down, waved my arms as he approached, he had no way of not seeing me trying to get his attention.

@calgarytransit Good Afternoon I am just wondering and requesting if some of the articulated buses could move from Victoria Park Garage over to the Spring Gardens Garage to enhance the social distancing?
@calgarytransit On the weekends
@calgarytransit Does the 92 that leaves Anderson stay the 92 once it reaches the end of the route in Mckenzie, or does it switch to the 96 there (like it does when it gets to Anderson)? I hope that made sense  d83d de48.
@calgarytransit Yes, somewhat. I have to kill some time today before work and was wondering if I caught the 92 at Anderson all the way to the end of the route, then catch it on it 2019s way back to Anderson and get off at the stop at my work, would I stay on the same bus, or switch at Mckenzie?
@calgarytransit To clarify, if I catch it too early, I 2019m at work sitting there for an hour and 15 minutes, or I 2019m late by 10 minutes.
@calgarytransit Ohh ok perfect. I can definitely do that. Thank you so much  d83d de0a.

@calgarytransit #1214 has no sign. Probably an 11. Could you ask the driver to poke the sign?
@calgarytransit @jeff_marsh @everydaytourist @DruhFarrell @DowntownWestYYC @DaleCalkins @LiveWireCalgary @CTVdawnwalton @joshyyc @311calgary Hello Calgary Transit.  Don't mean to harrass you, but the barrier to prevent passengers disembarking from westbound LRT at Lions Park station from jaywalking on 14th Ave NW side is still missing.  Very dangerous.... @311calgary https://t.co/bIqjZNnPQ1
@calgarytransit Was third between heritage and downtown 5-10 each time
@calgarytransit hey transit peeps. Could you let me know when the last redline train from downtown westbound is tonight?

@calgarytransit That digital ticket would come in handy.
@calgarytransit can we just make our own tickets at home
@Zanjandro @calgarytransit Only been a decade in the making here.

@Crackmacs @calgarytransit Or can we have cards we can reload ourselves online?
@all4huz @calgarytransit Well The date it is valid to (the UPASS) is printed on the sticker so i dont know why they need to communicate that. And it was communicated to you when you got it.
@Crackmacs @calgarytransit Went and bought some tickets instead of a pass. The driver on the first shuttle had me put the ticket in the box but didn't get a transfer, just said to tell the next driver to say that I paid on his route. Don't want to pay again if the next driver doesn't believe me.
@calgarytransit @Crackmacs Just going back to work next week but not worth it to get a pass. It's a learning curve for me for transit. Haven't had to take it in awhile
@Draymorren @calgarytransit alright but im saying it wasn 2019t. the date expires at the end of this year and i got no email from my university.
@all4huz @calgarytransit Then it should be August and it's still valid

@walkamile5683 @calgarytransit @SammyHudes @calgaryherald @nenshi @DruhFarrell @BigRedyyc It's too far for some to go.  For tourist it be really nice if the ride goes from the hotel to a Ctrain station. By making that happen it would also encourage CTA to pick up/ drop off clients there since they go where ct has a fixed route service.
@walkamile5683 @calgarytransit @SammyHudes @calgaryherald @nenshi @DruhFarrell @BigRedyyc The path going to the casino is inaccessible  for disabled folks and tourist with luggage. The on demand CT would remove that barrier. It would also make it safer for employees of the grey eagle to go home at night.

@calgarytransit What do I do if my ticket book hasn 2019t come in yet? I 2019ve been trying to pay cash but most drivers say they don 2019t have tickets. What do I do?
@calgarytransit Ordered it about a week ago. I know it takes 5-10 business days, but what can I do before the ticket book comes if most bus drivers get made if I try and offer cash payment?
@calgarytransit there is a lot of broken bottle pieces scattered on the lower floor if the whitehorn station. A piece ran right through my sneakers. Might pose a problem to those wearing slippers. Please attend right away. Have a great Monday.

@nenshi please make it mandatory to wear masks on transit. As more people start using transit it is impossible to maintain any social distance. @calgarytransit can you be leaders and get all drivers to wear masks. We can do better by coming together and protecting one another.

@calgarytransit They should be putting them in little baggies or something.
@calgarytransit The stop number is 6564  , I 2019m from Vancouver and the buses there go every 15-25 min at least . I think that should be implemented here as the buses are passing here every 45min .
@calgarytransit It 2019d be nice to have more efficiency , as for the buses itself , they are not well maintained i definitely think they need an update. Bc is doing a good job on this but i think Calgary can do better .

@calgarytransit Not only am I late to where u was supposed to go to this morning I 2019m confused as to what the protocols are, since the other maybe about 2 or 3 bus drivers I 2019ve encountered had ensured me that I was able to ride as long as I paid at the station.
@calgarytransit Tha you for clearing that up then. However how come I was denied access to the bus going to the train station even though I had clearly shown the driver my coins for a transfer. Do only some take the honour system? How can I be sure the next trip I take I won 2019t be denied again?
@calgarytransit I would like to be updated on the situation to ensure for myself and other passangers about this situation. I hope actions are taken, I was not even given a warning I hadn 2019t even stepped inside the bus yet. It is bus 15 stop 4753 beside the church at 10:50am.
@calgarytransit Thank you
@calgarytransit Thank you for taking your time to look into it.

@calgarytransit Thanks. But the stop is right in front of my house. No bus turned up.
@calgarytransit @CalgaryPolice   Seen at the base of the stairs at Marlborough C-Train station doing her drugs right out in the open.  She didn't care when I said I was notifying you.

@calgarytransit  I really need to catch bus 37 at 5:20 in heritage station
@calgarytransit and now i am still in station 5512 to wait bus no 3
@calgarytransit are busses still boarding thru the back doors?
@calgarytransit OK and no cash payment? What do I do if i need a transfer?  Can you confirm Bus 90 is leaving 11ave and 8 st SW at 6:15pm heading to foothills hospital?
@calgarytransit Bus comming at 5:15, it is way to late! I will miss bus 37 in herritage station
And there are 2 bus no 3  come at same time. One of them is really late! Thank you for your help
@calgarytransit Thank you. I know today the traffic is busy. Buy the first bus arrive the station at 4:48, ( it should arrive at 4:45). The second bus arrive at 5:15 together with third bus, I do not think the traffic is the main reason why bus is so late!
@calgarytransit Not really. But I understand bus pass away on time. I arrive the Herritage at 5:25. Next Bus 37 arrive around 5:30, should be leave at 5:40. That's fine. Thank you!
@calgarytransit Yes. I am on the bus 37 now

@calgarytransit Nice video
Is it normal for a bus to kick its passengers off in the middle of the route with ZERO explanation, saying the other bus was just outside but it 2019s been 8 minutes &amp; we are still waiting? Or? @calgarytransit
@calgarytransit It was the number 3 northbound and it dropped us off about 10 mins ago on 40th ave and centre street. He just stopped at the stop and said he 2019s out of service but the other bus was outside. We got off and there was no bus and he drove away.

@calgarytransit I find the gif a little disturbing though
@LiveWireCalgary It says contactless - is it barcodes that get scanned like the MyFare trial last year, or NFC (tap) based? @calgarytransit
@calgarytransit   I 2019m the only person out of ten on the number 3 wearing a mask.   Sad.    d83d de37
Sign of the times???   Parking lot maybe 20 cars. Two of us waiting for a bus and no busses in the loop @calgarytransit
@calgarytransit Hi did you get my reply ??
@asadyyc @LiveWireCalgary @calgarytransit The devices look more like barcode readers than NFC. In which case, how does this system get around the possibility of screenshots of a monthly pass?
@exolinguist @LiveWireCalgary @calgarytransit Many transit systems (Portland since 2013) use barcodes. Each fare would have unique, not easily predictable barcode (so each monthly pass would be different); transit tickets already have unique serial numbers. How spoof-proof it is will depend on implementation
@exolinguist @LiveWireCalgary @calgarytransit So each monthly pass will have different barcode or QR code
@asadyyc @LiveWireCalgary @calgarytransit Right, but does that barcode change  after each use? A month pass would need to be a time-limited, but in theory infinite, supply of single-use barcodes (nobody has ever explained how the month pass would work)
@exolinguist @LiveWireCalgary @calgarytransit No different than sharing your paper monthly pass if the same barcode stays. It will definitely be time-limited, likely to calendar month. I would anticipate at least a system lockout time (so if you scan a monthly pass now, same monthly pass can't be scanned for next 90 minutes)
@asadyyc @LiveWireCalgary @calgarytransit But that makes transfers impossible? Making a round trip to a grocery store?
@asadyyc @LiveWireCalgary @calgarytransit And the paper passes with holograms are harder to duplicate than it is to screenshot and airdrop. Like I said, nobody has explained how this will work.
@exolinguist @LiveWireCalgary @calgarytransit I think once you scan a fare / hit an activate button (as you would for single fare on LRT) it remains active/reusable/scannable on that device for 90 minutes. need to get the app to see details but hopefully all of this is sorted from trial+lots of other systems use barcodes
@calgarytransit @calgarytransit Will you be able to use a Visa-Debit card to pay for tickets or a pass?
@calgarytransit That 2019s great @calgarytransit ! Will paper tickets still work? I have two packs still.
@calgarytransit This is actually a big help so we dont have to go to places just to buy a transit pass
@calgarytransit Amazing news!!! I have been waiting so long for this to happen and can 2019t wait to use it.
@calgarytransit Will Low income monthly passes work on the app?
@calgarytransit Do you know when they planned to be added?
@calgarytransit So the buses cleaned often ..at least every night.  Is it just a coincidence that I took the 93 home from work last night and noticed 2 zip ties tied together on the floor of the bus near the bench seats by the back door, and they 2019re still there today?
@calgarytransit That 2019s awesome.  But 1 question. I purchase a monthly pass, my phone dies prior to the end of my shift and I can 2019t tap the scanner?  Now what?
@calgarytransit Wear a mask.

@worthingtonmik1 @AmyTanMD @jkwan_md @SharkawyMD @KashPrime @jvipondmd @danfurst @nenshi @doniveson @calgarytransit @takeETSalert Study not applicable. No one in this group (or on the planet?) is advocating for public use of N95s.  Cloth masks / surgical masks can be worn comfortably and are a helpful source control measure to reduce potentially virus laden droplets from entering the surrounding enviro.
@worthingtonmik1 @AmyTanMD @jkwan_md @SharkawyMD @KashPrime @jvipondmd @danfurst @nenshi @doniveson @calgarytransit @takeETSalert I think a more interesting question is this:  Knowing what we now know about the prevalence of asymptomatic spread and the value of masks as source control, is there a positive duty to mandate?

Love showing up to my stop 5 mins before the bus is scheduled to come.... Not seeing a bus walking over, and it being ten minutes past it's normal time. Guess @calgarytransit bus stop times are totally made up now!
@jodycannibal1 @calgarytransit Welcome to Calgary Transit, where the buses are decrepit and the times don't matter.
@AloneDoughnut @calgarytransit Yeah I super love just waiting around all the time because buses can just show up whenever they want. What a joke of a service
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sitting here since 1:42 So that bus went by what... 1:38? I can see the stop from my work. Didn't see any bus going by. What a joooooke @calgarytransit  d83e dd21 d83e dd21 https://t.co/jn9zJ3KzDk
@jodycannibal1 @calgarytransit I remember Selina having to uber when it was really cold because the bus just didn't stop for her
@AloneDoughnut @calgarytransit I honestly cannot stand that. especially when they pass stops early though. Shouldn't be a thing. I left work early to try to miss the rain and now I don't have a connecting bus when I get off

@calgarytransit aaaah I see things are back to normal....running for the train, doors close as you are there try and open, they close and off the train goes.....
@calgarytransit Will there be plans to integrate this with regional transit organizations like @roamtransit or @AirdrieTransit? Also will contactless fare cards come in the future whether using personal debit or a Calgary fare card?
@calgarytransit Will trains be back to 4 cars also?
@calgarytransit Is this app a separate one from  the Calgary transit app? I can 2019t find it anywhere near in my App Store. Or is it not out yet
Thank you @AvenueMagazine for showcasing Stampede public art. We are so proud of this installation in downtown #YYC #publicart #fafard #CalgaryStampede #CSart

@GuyCalgary @calgarytransit why would you have to remember it?  put it in once, you should be done....?
@calgarytransit finally!
@calgarytransit Do your operators understand this at all ?  I just had the driver of rt 9 bus 8333 tell me to scan my ticket on the reader to pay my fare.  I double checked after getting to my destination.  There is nothing for me to scan. If the operators are misinforming people, things are
@calgarytransit Going to go badly on July 1.
@exolinguist @asadyyc @LiveWireCalgary @calgarytransit I think the fares are kept in a e-ticket wallet. I don't know if you could just screenshot it to share it.  My fear is a dead battery. Waiting for the train or bus and your battery dies.  Free charging at terminals? Or pass is linked to phone number?  #yyc #yyctransit
Believe it when I see it and it lasts more than 3 months!  But wow. FINALLY!  About time @calgarytransit ! #yyc
@calgarytransit hi so I tried to get on the 126 and the driver had left the stop before I got there so I ran to the other side cause he was going around the circks and waved to him. He looked me dead in the eye and shook his head 'no' and kept going. I'm very upset
@calgarytransit is there any public transit at livingston and carrington area?
@calgarytransit Stop number 6097 it was for the 4:08 pm bus that just passed
@calgarytransit Thank you . I just found it very rude of him.
@YYCWarren @exolinguist @LiveWireCalgary @calgarytransit FAQ says if you wanna use e fare up to you to make sure your phone is working / charged. Remember paper fares aren 2019t going away
@calgarytransit Why is there no mention of riders without smartphones despite a lengthy FAQ section?  Also, 90 minutes is insufficient time to complete many trips across the city, especially with the current decreased bus frequency. @JeromyYYC @LiveWire_DK
I doubt @calgarytransit will appear on this very short list of cities that support ApplePay with Express Transit mode 2026 maybe the slightly longer list that supports standard ApplePay 2026  I kinda doubt it, but I would LOVE to be wrong.  https://t.co/7LfXRy3ciH
@collenbe @calgarytransit Thrilled  We're a Big City now.  Convenience helps.  thx @DruhFarrell
@calgarytransit @macphersonmattm I hope for the sake of accessibility and safety the low bus pass can be purchased on this app soon. @VibrantCalgary @nenshi @BigRedyyc @DruhFarrell .@actionhall @CalgaryAbility  #nocontact #mask
@STSTempest @calgarytransit @DruhFarrell Skeptically thrilled here. Track record would suggest holding back applause until it lasts a little while....   d83e dd37 200d 2642 fe0f #sadbuttrue
@calgarytransit @macphersonmattm While I'm glad that Calgary transit and @youralberta is providing people with a mask, they are single use one's. People with low incomes can't afford to get a mask once those free ones are gone. The app would help riders who can't afford the mask keep CT staff safe &amp; visa versa.
@collenbe @calgarytransit @DruhFarrell I'm so bummed out with hearing bad news that I went overboard a wee bit.  lol
@STSTempest @calgarytransit @DruhFarrell Totally get it !
@calgarytransit Can we buy low income bus passes with this ?
@calgarytransit @macphersonmattm People on AISH get paid on the first of each month. If they had this app they could stop buying a bus ticket to go get their low income bus pass on the 1st. They can get their bus pass while they're at home. @Actionhall #nofareevasion @calgaryability @goodfoodyyc @TheAlexCHC
- @calgarytransit could you please open Anderson Station? It's honestly annoying walking around the entire station. We haven't even had it open for a full year since it's been renovated. This is rediculous.  Sincerely, someone tired of leaving 15 minutes early unnecessarily. Thnx
@calgarytransit Ok.
@calgarytransit more drug use in one of the shelters on the chinook platform
@acrosspoem2 @calgarytransit @Actionhall @CalgaryAbility @goodfoodyyc @TheAlexCHC I buy low income bus passes, I can buy them online and have them sent to me on the calgary transit store. But I do agree this would be alot more useful
@calgarytransit Overall pretty good, one question though: is it the same app that we currently use to check schedule and routes? Hopefully it 2019s the same and there 2019re is no need to complete for valuable phone real estate  d83d de04
@calgarytransit @lfromerov *separate* :)
A week tomorrow I would have started working at Erlton stn for the 10th year doing fair collection for @calgarytransit down at the #stampede . #yyc will not be the same this year without the it. I 2019ll miss meeting all the tourists and seeing all the familiar faces I see every year
@calgarytransit Will the low income passes be available on this app as well, or will we need to still purchase the actual pass?
@calgarytransit Eeeeeek this is so exciting!!! Huge step towards a new way of doing things. Thanks for getting back to me as well!!!!
@calgarytransit when are ctrain buildings being reopened
@calgarytransit must be a problem with the timing board at erlton has said 11 min until next Tuscany train for last 5 min
@calgarytransit Ok thanks
Wow, someone @calgarytransit realised it's 2020 and technology is a thing. I'm still shocked you can't pay with your card/tap/contactless.  @cityofcalgary should exchange world class parking tech for world class transit tech from @TfL #yyc

@calgarytransit with the noticeable increase of transit riders..what is the estimated time frame till schedules get back to normal and 3 cars go to 4?? #SocialDistancing
@calgarytransit Awesome!
@calgarytransit I take the number 5 bus everyday and there isn 2019t enough buses that come every 15-20 min as it should be . BC has a bus often pass by can this happen here in Calgary ? Please
@calgarytransit Friends don 2019t let friends (or moms) scoot.
@calgarytransit just a friendly reminder, again, that 23 Ave SE in Ramsay is currently 30km/h. Please tell the #17 drivers comply and slow down.
@calgarytransit Thank you!

@calgarytransit Was probably just a light summer cold or hopefully just allergies, but still, gross.      Maybe give car 2457 a good scrub today.   #ewe #covidcalgary #transitchronicles
@calgarytransit Stay safe out there
@calgarytransit Only 10 percent of passengers wearing masks on my train ride home yesterday. Lots of people on the train too. Very scary
@classic_angela @calgarytransit Yesterday we took a long trip through downtown and same. Transit employee was on for 4 stops not masked. Agreed, t is very scary. More enforcement is needed.
@calgarytransit I was the only one wearing a mask on my bus yesterday. This included the driver who was front door boarding, had no mask and there was no barrier between him and us. Social distancing wasn 2019t being followed either. This is why taking transit is a last resort.
@calgarytransit please consider to add more trains. Trains are really crowded now. Hard to keep social distance from other fellow passengers.
@calgarytransit Almost nobody is wearing a mask for anyone.  Today out of 20 People on my bus only me and one other person wore masks.
@calgarytransit Hi! New to taking transit, I have one question, monthly pass is available to purchase on every 15th, for example now I can buy the pass for July, does that means I can start using it already or only works when it's July 1st to July 31st?
@calgarytransit Train I just got off at was packed. No where to either sit or stand and properly social distance. Why is this allowed?
@Sjaswal05 @calgarytransit I just had the exact same issue. Trains was packed. No where to sit or stand and properly social distance @nenshi
@calgarytransit We're sharing a busy bus or train car:  For others: it reduces the risk they'll get infected by me about 70%.  For me: it reduces the risk to me of getting infected by exhaled droplets by about 30%.
@calgarytransit there are about nearly 30 people no sitting 1 standing on route 1 bus 6047 going to forest lawn at inglewood now
@calgarytransit Trying to get home from work and wasn't let on the bus because three other people pushed ahead when the driver told us how many people could get on. I was the only person wearing a mask. Pretty angry about this. Run more buses at this time this is completely unfair.
@gimli_cat @calgarytransit If you are that worried maybe just stay home
@newellyyc @classic_angela @calgarytransit They can't force people to wear masks. Stay home if you dont like it
FYI: @calgarytransit will be doing maintenance and repair work this weekend, and Chinook, 39 Ave, Erlton, and Vic Park stations will be closed! Plan ahead! #yyc #yyctransit  https://t.co/veQcphoMTH https://t.co/J5jKZ421c8

@Daeva_ @calgarytransit Call them out on the spot.
@mikeevans1988 @calgarytransit @NStebanuk If you are so scared just stay home.   See how that goes both ways you big hypocrite.
@calgarytransit Your phone app said Max O would be westbound 16th Ave &amp; Edmonton Tr at 4:08. I arrived there at 4:02 &amp; waited until 4:28. Last Thurs I also arrived 4 minutes early, same stop, for Max O; it came 10 minutes late but then sat 4 min at Centre St. Why app inaccurate?

@shut_up_mary @calgarytransit I will for sure if it happens again. :\
@calgarytransit Woohoo! I 2019m looking forward to My Fare. We bought physical passes a couple weeks ago, any possibility to transfer to My Fare? Or maybe a 100% refund at a customer service location with proof of purchase of a digital fare?
@calgarytransit Full refund, or minus a service fee? I 2019ll be downtown Monday anyway.
@calgarytransit If the covid procedures are still in place, could the drivers please refrain from allowing standing room once the seats are full? Cheers!
@calgarytransit How am I supposed to pay bus fare if all I have is change??? I don 2019t take transit enough to buy tickets or a pass. (Only until July 1 I mean!!)
@calgarytransit You guys should consider some type of advertising for this service. Had to take the train home today, and not only was it completely packed with people and bikes. There was 1 out of every 15 people wearing a mask. And that 1 was me.
@calgarytransit Okay thank you!

@calgarytransit Almost no one was wearing masks on my commute today. It was disappointing. :(
@calgarytransit you have measures in place to keep from catching covid, but what about catching feelings?
@calgarytransit Make them mandatory on transit. Hadn 2019t been on transit since March 13 and was disappointed when I did again how few riders were wearing masks.
@calgarytransit I was disappointed that out of ten passengers I was the only person wearing a mask.
@calgarytransit Clearly, the app has a different opinion. Thanks.
@calgarytransit Will monthly passes be implemented in this app?
@calgarytransit Almost 90% is not wearing mask on my today commute to work. Both bus and train. Please make it a mendaroy. Please coughing and sneezing like crazy and they don 2019t have mask on. I don 2019t understanding it 2019s so difficult to wear mask.

@calgarytransit The announcement system on train 2324 is broken. But it's possible the driver is shutting them off.
@calgarytransit Currently headed towards Canyon meadows they literally died as we were leaving Somerset.
@calgarytransit No I'm pretty sure the driver is cancelling them they started working again and now they are cutting out. As they come in

@calgarytransit Bus 7937 2019s driver is letting people on through the front door instead of the back.
You know @calgarytransit it's frustrating to get on the little buses with a walker &amp; have no place to sit because you've got one seat cord off the other won't open so I can sit down. WTH?!?! Now I have to get off &amp; wait for a big bus!

@calgarytransit It looks like you can't load credit to the app and just use it until it runs out and instead have to buy single tickets or passes. Is that correct?

@calgarytransit I'm confused. My brother was refused transit service, because he is wearing a mask. So he waited for another bus, he was harassed by that bus driver, for boarding through the rear wearing a mask.  Something I do everyday Including today without incident.@kupodono
@calgarytransit Excluding those without smart phones I guess, because the reality is that not everyone has one.
@calgarytransit car 2454. Display broken. We are at Fish Creek now. https://t.co/NcIFAbxiAx
@calgarytransit @kupodono I will pass this along to my brother. Since it happened to him twice. The second driver called the cops on him, after he demanded that my brother explain why he was wearing a mask. My brother explained and the driver called the cops for being argumentative.

@calgarytransit When will the Tuscany train be at 7th St station?

@calgarytransit Wearing black jacket and grey pants, I'm off at city hall. She was still on the train.
@michaellemagnum @macphersonmattm @calgarytransit Again, you 2019re missing the point. Cash payments and physical tickets will never go away. We still have old folks who don 2019t use smartphones and even card payments. Bigger cities with more advanced ticketing systems don 2019t have issues &amp; they 2019ve been doing it for years now.
@leepalisoc @macphersonmattm @calgarytransit Good. Fine, and thank you.
@calgarytransit Finally  d83d de0d
@calgarytransit Great now we get to pay for your shitty service again.
@calgarytransit What? Finally?? When I've stopped riding transit. I can't believe it only took a pandemic for this to happen. Sadly it was cheaper for my wife and I to split a parking pass at work than it was to ride two train stops on monthly passes.
@calgarytransit Will this work for ordering low income bus passes?
@calgarytransit Will our monthly passes be a available through this app? Or is it only for one time use tickets?
@LoganPhive @cultureyyc @Canada @YourAlberta Just in case I forget to wear my cloth mask when I go to see my pal later at the park by his place I put this in my backpack. Thank you @calgarytransit for giving it to me. #mask4allCanadians https://t.co/461tyoVAJl
@calgarytransit Only 3 days notice.
@calgarytransit Really good news. Looking forward to trying the app out.
@Calgarytransit can you open the ctrain stations already. We always miss the bus because they never wait for people having to walk after getting off the train. Its ridiculous. I feel so ripped off paying for such terrible service. The WORST public transit in Canada. Hire better.
@AmyTanMD @jkwan_md @SharkawyMD @KashPrime @jvipondmd @danfurst @robshirkey @nenshi @doniveson @calgarytransit @takeETSalert A few Asian Countries have really shown the benefit of using masks smartly, whereas we North Americans are more worried about our pride, special south of our border

Heya @calgarytransit dont understand why trains go out of service in rush hour  ive nebmver understood why do this  pre or during pandemic  train at 751 wenr out if service with pol on platform no train or train times in sight
@calgarytransit @Lee_McMillan @cityofcalgary Why can 2019t we install the front bike racks? I mean, the buses don 2019t go everywhere, taking your bike with you makes more sense in that case, doesn 2019t it?

@calgarytransit Rush hour is over at 751?  Really!  Ill make sure to inform wveryone I know!!  Generally this shows that u dont know the flow of ur riders  bc there were more people on at that time than whn i normally take the train at 6
@calgarytransit @Lee_McMillan @cityofcalgary Then all buses should have bike rakes out front
@calgarytransit I've stood outside and looked into the building. Can't afford to go into Heritage Park anymore while in this ongoing nightmare. Miss it actually.
@calgarytransit Interesting. What is this "normal", you speak of ? I've been held hostage so long and forced into this dysfunction, words like normalcy, decency, respect are absent.
@calgarytransit Its SIGNIFICANTLY busier now
@calgarytransit correct me if I'm wrong,  but are drivers not supposed to follow all road signs and speed limits?? Why is it both routes through my area cannot follow the 30km posted playground zones?? Drivers should lead by example no?
@calgarytransit @Crackmacs No screenshots of how the tickets will look if you're using it correctly? It'd be nice to know before using the app for the first time.
@calgarytransit How about that electronic card that you were promising years ago, like tons of cities around the world have? It would be much simpler, and of course you don't need a smart phone.

@calgarytransit With my fare app can bus pass be down loaded as well?
@calgarytransit Ok thanks
@calgarytransit I certainly will. You as well have a great day
@calgarytransit Everywhere not just transit stations
@calgarytransit I haven 2019t taken transit in a few months. At Heritage, are we allowed to go through the station yet or do we still have to use the outside ramps?
@calgarytransit Thanks for letting me know! Have a good day!
@calgarytransit How often are trains cleaned during the day?
@calgarytransit train I'm on is packed. Isn't there a law saying 2 meter apart? Does city of calgary transit have to follow rules or are they exempt ???? https://t.co/YEtuU2daQD

@calgarytransit How many masks each package? Is there a limit?
@calgarytransit Is there a way transit can make seats more comfortable? They are had on the lower back.

Please ensure your amended targets are communicated with supporting documentation to account for the 20 percent delta. This will be a point of order in your submission.
@calgarytransit , I see that your website now says the following "We 2019re handing out one mask per person, but if you 2019re picking up an additional mask for a neighbour or friend, just let us know." It was better before, when it said you could &amp; would give people packages of masks.
Lol I just saw a @calgarytransit bus with  201chappy stampedeing 201d on its sign
@parker_kip @calgarytransit Only looks packed in 1 area.looks like they are together
@calgarytransit @parker_kip Then I guess it's time to put more buses back on the road. I've seen it myself, there are more people taking buses.

When your bus blows past the stop early it is super disappointing @calgarytransit. With reduced service the train times and bus times are entirely out of sync!!
@calgarytransit I don't have the information needed to report it. It was route #78, I don't know the stop number as I have now left that area to take a different bus. It was about three minutes early, and while that's not a lot, it's enough for someone getting off the train to miss it.

@calgarytransit I honestly don't know that info. I go by the app or teletext times. I had 8 minutes before it was to show up, was waiting to cross the street and watched it drive past. Checked the app again and it still said I had 4 minutes to catch it but obviously it had already come and gone

@calgarytransit Could we make masks mandatory on transit?
@Catippytoes @calgarytransit Very true.
@calgarytransit - Effective Wednesday, are monthly bus passes available once again for purchase in the city, or is it still the honour system with the pandemic still ongoing?
@calgarytransit I have bus tickets that I purchased back in April, I was just curious if things changed on Wednesday.
@lectio @calgarytransit I thought that had already happened! Clearly I haven 2019t needed to go anywhere recently

@nenshi @calgarytransit Note I 2019m not telling people living in these places to go out now, I 2019m just saying eventually theY will, and when they do they should be able to get their pass without getting sick due to lack of income, like everyone else can

@mikeevans1988 @nenshi @calgarytransit It was working fine for the pilot protest l project.  I used it for 3 months.  I do understand your scepticism though.  The thing about it right now is that we can't get to the scanner to scan in the ticket.
@calgarytransit Sitting will it be still distancing? Because some drivers are not doing it. They let passengers sit close together ans stang up. Not limitting number of passengers inside
@calgarytransit Is the transit free for tomorrow?
@calgarytransit Okay Perfect! Thank you so much. The app would be really helpful

@TheBloodyIron @nestorsaye1 @nenshi @calgarytransit I 2019m not the policy maker, that isn 2019t my job. It 2019s up to citizens to advocate for what they want and it 2019s up to lawmakers to hear us and do what is best for the most vulnerable in our community. I 2019m sure the mayor knows how to research various models. Thanks for trolling though.
Tim's is under investigation for privacy concerns, so we thought we'd ask before using Calgary Transit's My Fare (no disclosure to users on their web site ahead of the launch tomorrow).    They told us to call a supervisor to find out  (apparently they don't know)?
@calgarytransit Everyone else on the train and those they will be in contact with
@calgarytransit You could make July 1st free for riders. That would make things a lot easier for riders!
@calgarytransit  two guys here on train bothering everyone... saddletown ctrain last car ... train going towards Bridgeland / memorial station
Isn 2019t My Fare app available on Apple store? Can 2019t find it.  My Low Income monthly pass hasn 2019t arrived yet, ordered on June 20. Can i still use June pass till it arrives? @calgarytransit

@calgarytransit why is the #20 never on time at 10:00pm at southbound crow child at 33rd Ave? I live near Chinook and always have to take the 20 all the way to Heritage just to go north again because I missed the connection to the number nine at mru
@calgarytransit 10:07

@calgarytransit nice to see on the news a fellow Welshy Russell Davies acting director. I'm assuming he's from the Rhondda valeys or somewhere close to me in South Wales from the sound of the accent.
The @calgarytransit My Fare app is out on Google Play  https://t.co/y7gJ8biUtj  Can't find it for iOS yet.   Single tickets/day passes are valid for 7 days. Rest looks normal. #yyc #yyccc https://t.co/AHRkoWRpub
@calgarytransit Wheres the iOS My Fare app?
@J9Moir @nenshi @calgarytransit If you're still looking, it's called My Fare. I just downloaded, and bought a test ticket no problem.
@Crackmacs @calgarytransit "But Mr. Peace Officer, Sir.. I activated my ticket before entering the fare paid zone! I can't help it if my mobile data doesn't work inside Sunalta station!"
RT @Crackmacs: The @calgarytransit My Fare app is out on Google Play  https://t.co/y7gJ8biUtj  Can't find it for iOS yet.   Single tickets/ 2026
@Crackmacs @calgarytransit Yet they haven't disclosed what personal info the app, service provider, and/or City or anyone else is collecting. And it's live now.  No answers.  So thinking of the Tim's privacy investigation, I hope they don't get sued (and Taxpayers pick up the tab somewhere down the road).

@Crackmacs @calgarytransit I keep checking for iOS. Was hoping I could download before today so I could look at it and figure out before the new month started. I 2019ll just buy a paper pass this month and wait to see if it 2019s available and working next month. No time to download and figure out before work.

@nenshi Thank you for promoting masks and to @calgarytransit for installing the new fare payment system. I believe masks need to be mandatory to avoid causing a resurgence of #COVID19AB .

@calgarytransit I have to go to work soon, I need to buy monthly pass on MyFare, it 2019s already on Google Store but not App Store yet, what should I do! Don 2019t want to get rejected by your drivers.
@calgarytransit Hi, I can 2019t find the app when I searched for it. Has anyone else found it?
@calgarytransit Hopefully the iOS app is available soon. Can 2019t find it in the App Store yet
@calgarytransit Ill be using my regular tickets this month and see how the etickets pan out.  It was a mess in Vancouver when it rolled out, customers overcharged, tickets not validated...etc.
@calgarytransit Im high risk, so I mostly wear it for me. I also work with patients who are high risk and would hate to inadvertently carry and transmit the virus to them.
@calgarytransit @TJMorris238 Is transit free today since its canada day?

@NSavage2015 @calgarytransit This is why I purchased a traditional pass for July. Knew there would be issues at the start.
@calgarytransit I searched apple 2019s App Store for My Fare and no app result comes up that looks appropriate.   Could you update the page with a link to the store app and provide it here for both iOS and Android.
@calgarytransit re: My Fare.  You guys need to provide a link directly to the app on the app stores.  I have searched for  201cMy Fare 201d on my iOS App Store and didn 2019t find it.
@calgarytransit can you provide the link to the app store to download the new my fare app please.  I am unable to find it
@calgarytransit   I 2019m not finding the new My Fare ap.  Is it out ?? I 2019m using an Apple phone
@calgarytransit Why I cant find the my fare app yet on my apple store?
@calgarytransit My Fare? iPhone? July 1
@calgarytransit Will the My Fare app be able to load a balance, so that my kids can use tickets when they need to without needing my credit card?
RT @nenshi: Tomorrow, @calgarytransit launches My Fare. This new mobile ticketing app will allow for contactless payment, and help to reduc 2026
@calgarytransit @kateyandoc What a joke.   Pathetic.
@calgarytransit LOL i didnt buy a monthly pass because I saw the app it will be much easier for me and in the end it 2019s not in the app store yet cmon  d83d de12
@calgarytransit Still can 2019t find the My Fare app on the Apple App store, a link to it on the website would be useful
@RoganX4 @Crackmacs @calgarytransit According to their FAQ you don't need data you activate, just to purchase.
@calgarytransit Can't find the My Fare app in the App Store.  Tried searching for "My Fare" and "Calgary Transit" and it does not appear.
@calgarytransit   how do I buy a myfare with my debit card??  I dont see an option for interact on the app??
@calgarytransit @kateyandoc You guys didn 2019t say that it wouldn 2019t be available for iOS I didn 2019t buy a monthly pass because I thought I would be able to buy it on my phone. Is it going to be available today on iOS or is it going to be a while?
@calgarytransit Thank you,   first big failure of the app not allowing intract    bring that up to the myfare team
@calgarytransit I bought a monthly pass early this morning on-line coz the app is not available yet(I was waiting for it) but I have to go to work. Can I use my receipt for now until I receive the pass?
@calgarytransit  where is the new app I tried looking for it on the apple store and it 2019s not there.
@calgarytransit When will I get my pass then?
@calgarytransit You should have introduced this app in advance not on the 1st day  of the month
@calgarytransit In which case, put something on the FAQ 2019s then.  I 2019ve been wasting a lot of time trying to find it!
@calgarytransit When is the iOS app going to be available, will it be later today or a few weeks? I don 2019t understand why you just didn 2019t say that it will only be available on Android first and iOS later. Then people would have known they needed to go out and buy a pass.
@calgarytransit Searching for  201cmy fare 201d or  201cmy fare Calgary 201d on the Apple App Store does not show the app. Do you have a direct link to the download?
@calgarytransit Unable to locate on the App Store this morning......
@calgarytransit Can 2019t find My Fare on the App Store ???
@calgarytransit Is the app called My Fare? Can't find it on Google Play.
@calgarytransit Happy Canada Day!! I 2019m looking for the new app, My Fare, and I can 2019t find it. Has it been launch?
@calgarytransit My point being is that you 2019re asking people to download it from the App Store now.  I 2019m sure I 2019m not the only one looking for it given the system is live today.
@calgarytransit It is still not available. Can i use my June pass?
@calgarytransit Another fail by Calgary Transit... you could have had the iOS app waiting in the App Store to be released today, instead you do a media blitz about your great My Fare app and it 2019s not even available. @CTVCalgary @CBCCalgary
@calgarytransit having an issue   I bought a prepaid visa and am trying to buy my Monthly pass on the new app but I keep getting a billing information error???      I need this pass before 10am
@calgarytransit where can I get the myfare app to buy a monthly pass?  It 2019s not on the App Store.
@calgarytransit I can't seem to find my fare for android as well.
@calgarytransit   Is the 502 running today. If so when does it depart Heritage Station
@calgarytransit Will the MyFare app have low income passes linked to your CalgaryID under "My tickets" ? I live near the Southland Rec center and I can't purchase my pass there anymore.
@calgarytransit My devices are Apple IOS...so stick with the paper card?
@calgarytransit can you give me a link to Myfare https://t.co/Gv3D5axze0 like to try the new system
@nenshi @EWoolleyWard8 @calgarytransit   Two of ten passengers on the #3 bus 8036.  Have a mask.  Oh and the driver has his curtain open.  Useless protection #COVID19
@calgarytransit Hello I need your help!  I need a single ticket..but how? I am away from all your centres, I don't need 25 single tickets like in your store, I have no idea in which stores I can buy a ticket and I cannot find the myfare app (searched play store and app store)...what can I do? https://t.co/MZDMfupCTc
@calgarytransit It was running on the weekend
@calgarytransit Update your faq till it 2019s fixed then. Misleading information. https://t.co/vr5CmHMi7H
@calgarytransit This is just ridiculous. Should have informed if the app is not going to work. Can i pay cash then?
@calgarytransit https://t.co/TEoex0aqeu
@calgarytransit Thanks...Disappointed with this.  Was not communicated in any of the media or Twitter posts.  Feedback for your PR folks!
@calgarytransit Will you be sharing the links to the app in their respective App Store? It is still unseachable.
@calgarytransit wow all the buses I was on were empty! Thanks for finally kicking all the homeless people off after 3 months. Are peace officers finally giving out tickets as well? So the ctrains are some much more safer and cleaner?
@calgarytransit @KarenFranco1 Wtf?????
@calgarytransit @St0n3c0LdHeArt You guys are disgusting. He payed for a unlimited pass and you app has failed! Make it right!
@calgarytransit I have an iPhone , went to the link but no option to purchase a ticket or download an app
@calgarytransit @missghoulinax Your not sorry. It's just a word to you. Disgusting!!!!
@calgarytransit @InfoBooth2 Your own website says the app is available for iOS and Android as well as your media coverage. If you couldn 2019t get things together on time you shouldn 2019t make announcements.
@Steve_J_K @calgarytransit @CTVCalgary @CBCCalgary @nenshi. Did you know that they have been promoting the my fare app like crazy for today. And yet not available in IOS app store. People who bought digital bus pass are being forced to pay for daily fare
Calgary is the shittiest city right now!

@calgarytransit It 2019s NOT a package.  Quit embellishing.
@calgarytransit The payment actually finally  went through so its all good thank you
@calgarytransit really dropped the ball on the release of the app for IOS maybe you should have made sure it was good to go prior to today?
@calgarytransit Available on Android only until August.
@calgarytransit Do you know roughly when it will become available for IOS?
@kipsy1979 @calgarytransit @St0n3c0LdHeArt You are actually the one that is disgusting. How is this any of your business? Did you pay for the pass for the person that was originally asking the question? If not, then STFU

@calgarytransit strike one for My Fare. Not in the App Store for IOS. Kind of a let down, seeing as how the mayor was on the news saying it 2019s ready to roll!
@calgarytransit is there a link to the my fare app? Can 2019t find it ?
@calgarytransit I was at the stop around 9:45
@calgarytransit It 2019s ok it came 20 mins late but was already on the other side of the street because I knew that the other 93 would come.

@missghoulinax @calgarytransit This  d83d dc46 d83c dffb. Wasn 2019t planning on going to a store today, but now have to make a trip to get a pass.
Anyone here surprised? Didn't think so... #yyccc @calgarytransit @cityofcalgary
@calgarytransit On the CT site.   Suggest this be updated if incorrect.   Is My Fare available on all devices? My Fare is available on the majority of iOS or Android devices installed with the current or previous major version operating system. Older versions of software may not be supported.
@calgarytransit @asadyyc In addition to linking to the apps, actually put them on the App stores... they are still missing....
@calgarytransit any news on when the myFare app will be on the Apple store?  Some of us need to use the bus tomorrow and would like to check out the app before we get tickets and reprimands from the peace officers
So it seems like nobody actually submitted the My Fare app to the Apple Store? Really guys? I guess the tech team remains as incompetent as ever, but how many hits to your reputation can they get away with? @calgarytransit @nenshi
@calgarytransit I 2019m on an Apple phone.
@calgarytransit City of Calgary has wrong info on their website then.
@calgarytransit sooooo, parking is free on Canada day but not transit?.... maybe it would be a good idea as to also minimize some of the poor resulting decisions... there are LOTS of cities that offer free transit today
@calgarytransit is there a link to the iOS version of My Fare? It doesn 2019t come up in the search?
@calgarytransit @missghoulinax Can you explain how this happened? You announced a July 1 launch more than a week ago and yet the app isn 2019t available for iPhones
@calgarytransit  do you guys have masks at the customer service centre right now ?
@calgarytransit hey! Is route #149 on service today ?
Hey @calgarytransit when did you start using front doors again? Like...confused?
@calgarytransit Tnx
@calgarytransit please provide a link to download the new my fare app to buy pass and tickets online. Cannot find the app on the app store. Please help with a link. Thanks
@calgarytransit will you guarantee the app will be released today? Or should we wait and see tomorrow?

@dapperwolfboy @calgarytransit Somebody has been offline the last few weeks. This has been announced multiple times
@calgarytransit @TimDotChoi The Google Play store is on Android.  Is the iOS/Apple version out yet?
@calgarytransit @Crackmacs As @Crackmacs noted, I mentioned Google Play, so Android.
@calgarytransit @Crackmacs @TimDotChoi It seems to be listed as My Fare. To make it easier to find, it SHOULD be listed as Calgary Transit My Fare
@calgarytransit I am using an Apple phone and I cannot find it in the app store
@footwearken @calgarytransit @Crackmacs Yeah, found it when searching just "My Fare" - had to look up on CT's website what the app's actual name was. It really should have Calgary Transit in the title since most people would probably be searching for that rather than the incredibly generic "My Fare".
@TimDotChoi @calgarytransit @Crackmacs Pretty unimpressed with the lack of availability on IOS. Yet another blunder by Calgary Transit.
@calgarytransit Thank you so much for your timely reply. Yes I will keep checking for Twitter updates. Happy Canada Day d83d de03
@calgarytransit @pratiksoni61 What do I do for a fare? I didn 2019t buy a pass for July as I was going to use the iOS app, now I have to take the bus.
OOOOPS @calgarytransit 'My Fare' app not ready for @Apple devices on launch day https://t.co/JdZWdCysAu  #facepalm #yyc @cityofcalgary https://t.co/uuzQpLqNJN

@calgarytransit Thanks
@calgarytransit @pratiksoni61 No cash, and need to take transit to get a fare.
@calgarytransit @KarenFranco1 Can you provide a timeline? Is it days away? Weeks? Months?
@calgarytransit how am I supposed to get on the bus when the app isn 2019t available and I don 2019t have time to go to the store and get tickets. Ridiculous honestly.
@calgarytransit The app doesn't even work some people have complained about it
@calgarytransit @nenshi  This morning, I had to take the bus. Just wondering if everything is back to normal now? Front of the bus boarding, giving out transfers, no screens, lack of distancing on the bus, and no masks. But same signage about covid19 rules. Has something changed? https://t.co/yJ6hzzPzSI
The masks, was more about having close contact with the driver while paying fare/entering from front of bus, and the driver has had endless contact with people in a day, and wasnt wearing one, nor using the screen. Its as much about their safety, as CT riders. @calgarytransit
@calgarytransit So is the app you are pushing one of the reasons why the sev by my house doesn't have July passes?
@calgarytransit @nenshi Thank you for clarifying !
@calgarytransit is the My Fare app live yet? Can't find it on the iOS App Store.
@calgarytransit @nenshi Actually can you please clarify the mask and distancing dealio?
@calgarytransit Pro-tip. Having a more detailed tweet about it being limited to only Android users at the moment would avoid further customer confusion. Also update the page you link to for "more info" as it says it is available on both Android and iOS platforms.  d83e dd2a
@calgarytransit @KarenFranco1 Why did CT wait till the midnight hour to launch this out. Public information has been collasially weak. Its like your taking PR pointers from the UCP. Not a good look.  Your coaches and stops have no app info for riders to learn about this. Even social media has been slack
@calgarytransit hi! pls make an apple watch app for calgary transit app and the new my fare when it comes out on ios. specially now, people don 2019t wnat their phones out often in public, they are dirtier than most belongings
@calgarytransit @cryha_games  d83d de44
@calgarytransit @St0n3c0LdHeArt Recept should be valid enough. At this point its a cash grab.  Very poor PR!!!!!!!
@calgarytransit @nenshi  @CBCCalgary @GlobalCalgary @CTVCalgary
@calgarytransit @nenshi The only thing that doesn't clarify, is the drivers. This morning our driver wasn't wearing a mask/screen left open. Mask aside, they have the most frequent contact with riders, and are high risk themselves and to the riders for catching cov19, esp. When passing out transfers.
@calgarytransit Is there a timeline for the iOS app? Is it being moderated by Apple? Thanks!
@calgarytransit Can we still pay with regular bus tickets? I plan to wait to see how this all rolls out. I asked this same question yesterday but didnt get a response. Trying again.
@calgarytransit This actually has made it harder. App not available for ios and regular passes not a available at regular stores and shops.  What a mess.  d83d de44
@calgarytransit @nenshi Sorry CT, I would rather not at this time, as I don't want one employee to be reprimanded, when I'm just asking about transit as a whole.
@GoodrickC @calgarytransit oh my.  Yes please wear gloves.
@calgarytransit thank u! happy canada day  d83e dd70 d83e dd70
@CBEBusProblems @calgarytransit So ppl will start paying again.  There have been a lot of non fare paying riders the last couple months.
@calgarytransit Did you mean the end of July???
@klaszus @dbinyyc Next time @calgarytransit get the app through Apple 2019s App Store Review, publicly available for download, and pilot-tested, before publishing on your website it  201cis available 201d and committing to a hard launch date.  https://t.co/GKLyWzWqXw https://t.co/q3WDMZet0R
@klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit I think the issues may be substantial, relating to payment model for single tickets &amp; monthly passes, storage in Apple Wallet, availability on all devices, privacy &amp; security, ownership of purchase data, payment with Apple Store credit...  Web app may have been better.
@calgarytransit Yes actually the app  has made it much harder to buy your fares...stores didnt bother to stock passes expecting riders to download the app, which isnt a available for everyone.  What a Mess. How are you rectifying this @calgarytransit?
@ZiadFazel @dbinyyc @calgarytransit Yikes. I didn 2019t say anything when they announced the launch, because I wasn 2019t going to get all excited until I had it in hand. Now we wait...
@calgarytransit @BScribbins @JeromyYYC @LiveWire_DK Except many of those vendors havent re-opened. Do you have a link to these vendors for purchasing?
@klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit Transport for London has an app for its contactless and Oyster cards. They ask you wait up to 30 min for your purchase to be available in the app.   https://t.co/64C2P6GAiA  It has a 1.3 out of 5 rating from 11 reviews, in the Canadian store. https://t.co/sIaMLbzumf
@calgarytransit .....next question.  Where can I buy more.  My current package will run out after tomorrow.  Is their a online list of vendors? Ive checked the Safewayx Shoppers and even a 7-11 in my neighbourhood. Nothing.
@calgarytransit @nenshi Thank you , hope you're having a good Wednesday.
@klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit Finally, please don 2019t beat up on the @calgarytransit employees doing customer service today.   They obviously got hung out to dry on Canada Day by decision-makers at Calgary Transit who should have known better.  Launching a public service on a stat holiday is never a good idea.
@calgarytransit You only have 1 dwtn and Im at work till 5pm.
@calgarytransit Not available for iOS, what a joke
@Hispta_Dada @calgarytransit Just the first of many problems with this app I 2019m sure.
@missghoulinax @calgarytransit why announce this if it 2019s not going to be available on all devices? Should 2019ve made sure it would be available before announcing.
@calgarytransit you have 2 vehicles parked in stop number 8451
RT @ZiadFazel: @klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit I think the issues may be substantial, relating to payment model for single tickets &amp; mont 2026
@nenshi @calgarytransit 3 strikes and you are out... Lol..  the app doesnt work with iphones..    maybe the city should not try building this app their self and find out what other city has already done this???  https://t.co/7wl9CsjiyQ
@calgarytransit unreal..  3 time isnt the charm..    https://t.co/7wl9CsjiyQ
@calgarytransit I has asked the cashier at the store after they handed me a June pass. They said they hadn't received the passes for the month.  If Calgary Transit is trying to push people to use this App. It would be best to actually be upfront about it.
RT @klaszus: @ZiadFazel @dbinyyc @calgarytransit Yikes. I didn 2019t say anything when they announced the launch, because I wasn 2019t going to get 2026
@calgarytransit Wasting tax payers $
RT @ZiadFazel: @klaszus @dbinyyc Next time @calgarytransit get the app through Apple 2019s App Store Review, publicly available for download, a 2026
@calgarytransit No doubt.  Everyone with iPhones are heading out to buy their monthly passes at a store today after searching the App Store only to find out now it  201cmay not be available 201d for iOS devices.  Really?!?
RT @ZiadFazel: @klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit Finally, please don 2019t beat up on the @calgarytransit employees doing customer service toda 2026
Seconded.
@calgarytransit What is myfare app?! How long has this been a thing?
@optiontrader44 @calgarytransit Not really, wtf. The fact that I have to run to an atm if I need to take a bus, could pay atm fees and then get a 20 that I need change for.... nah they needed this on the bus ages ago. This will help a lot of people!
@_FRESHPRINTZ_ @calgarytransit It launched today
@calgarytransit can we still board at the back of the bus and rip our tickets or everyone boards at the front again?
@calgarytransit I 2019m embarrassed for Calgary transit. This is such a huge fail. Why say it 2019s ready to be launched when in reality it isn 2019t.
@calgarytransit quick question on the myfare app, the single day ticket is only valid for 7 days, but the paper Version is valid for a lot longer, why only 7 days, thanks
@klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit Developers get App Store Connect to see progress, invite testers or media to take a pre-release  201cTestFlight 201d, and choose whether to release as soon as app is approved, or at future date after approval. You know, the smart way, tied to a launch date. https://t.co/yAU80n7szu
@calgarytransit Yes I did and thankfully they had one.   Again if Calgary transit is pushing to have people transition over to this app. Be upfront about it, There has been little to no news about this app.
@klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit Also, launching a new product simultaneously in both platforms is foolish. Work the bugs out and adapt your features on one platform first. If you 2019re planning to sell tickets or passes in the app to Candian public using credit cards, you start with iOS. https://t.co/oo7SRBT6fX

@calgarytransit So was the mayor and director of transit lying or just grossly misinformed when they told everyone at yesterday 2019s press conference to use it starting today. Perhaps it would have been wise to have it ready to go BEFORE promoting to the public?
@_FRESHPRINTZ_ @optiontrader44 @calgarytransit I agree that this system is long overdue. But it is problematic when it doesn't work properly.   This isn't the first time though. They spent a fortune (twice) on the Connect tap-and-go fare card system back in 2012 that ultimately didn't even work.
@calgarytransit Couldn 2019t have told us before July 1
@calgarytransit Any chance you can put the link to the exact app on Google Play. There is not one called myfare
@calgarytransit I can't find MyFare for for Android. I know you said it's not available for iOS but I can't find it for my samsung either.
@calgarytransit Just noticed there is no space between my and fare... my bad!
@klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit Deal-breaker!   Transit tickets purchased in app expire 7 days from date of purchase, and cannot be refunded.  https://t.co/FyDuHm1GNj  Appears to violate Apple Store policies. Maybe federal law if this is like movie passes.  https://t.co/GKLyWzEPyW  /c @DruhFarrell @nenshi https://t.co/slZuAkbisH
@calgarytransit explain to me why your drivers are allowed to be verbally abusive and then twist it onto customers? I was struggling to find change and as I tried to pay on my way off as I had to spend the trip finding NOT ENOUGH change, your driver called me a dumb cunt
@calgarytransit @asadyyc @missghoulinax And...didn 2019t answer the question... excellent job.  Cc: @cityofcalgary @nenshi
@calgarytransit can I get my mouthy pass on the my fare app?
@ZiadFazel @dbinyyc @calgarytransit @DruhFarrell @nenshi Well that is interesting...
@klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit @DruhFarrell @nenshi I 2019m better off buying a book of 10 tickets. They don 2019t expire, and if prices go up 10 cents, you pay with a ticket + dime. Pretty sure you can get refund on unused ticket (books) too.  @calgarytransit If I buy monthly pass in app, then app crashes or is deleted, is pass lost too?
@calgarytransit This is why it should have been launched mid month. Imagine thinking you could download the app and buy your monthly pass. Then you find out someone dropped the ball and now you have to scramble for bus fare and then find somewhere that has a paper pass.   It off to a good start
@calgarytransit What about low income passes ?
@calgarytransit one should be able to use there pre-purchased ticket anytime no matter how it is payed for. Get rid of the 6 day time period to use the fare via the app
@calgarytransit Why? Most people using transit these days are retail workers and our hours are still the same today. All this will do is make it even more difficult to practice social distancing on ctrains and buses.
@calgarytransit You 2019re kidding right? New My Fare app not made available for iPhones? What were you thinking?  d83e dd37 d83c dffb 200d 2642 fe0f

This.
@klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit @DruhFarrell @nenshi Imagine if we weren 2019t in a pandemic, and Calgary was full of visitors for Stampede, here 10 days to 2 weeks.  On arrival, they buy tickets/day passes to get around to Stampede, Zoo, Heritage Park, BRT from/to airport.  Halfway through vacation, poof! Tickets expire, no refund. https://t.co/L9G1riyBJO
This.  If correct.  There are simple, basic laws and rules that you must follow and why we were asking questions before this went live today.
@ZiadFazel @klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit @DruhFarrell @nenshi They still haven't addressed privacy questions (info collected, who collects it, how they maintain it - think Tim's app situation); disclosing up front to Users; fairly standard to consider pre-launch. Can people volunteer at the City? They seem to need some help in a few areas.

@ZiadFazel @klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit @DruhFarrell @nenshi Last thing anyone wants is an investigation or lawsuit to City by Users (or imagine a tourist &amp; related int'l PR).  Needs some serious attention from Senior Management.  This project for easier fare pay started up in 2009.  Thanks in advance Mayor Nenshi &amp; City Manager Duckworth.
@nenshi @calgarytransit Just saw on the news it doesn 2019t work on IPhones! Sweet rollout team!
RT @missghoulinax: @calgarytransit When is the iOS app going to be available, will it be later today or a few weeks? I don 2019t understand why 2026
@calgarytransit Too bad. Reduced fares would be worth celebrating.  d83c df89 d83e dd73 d83d de00
@karen_rathwell @mikeevans1988 @nenshi @calgarytransit Confirmed, CTV just reported it doesn 2019t work on iPhones
@calgarytransit Maybe you should ask the developers/testers when it will be ready and publish that date, rather than have all iPhone user customers check the App Store every day.
@calgarytransit Heritage station-the stairs up to the pedestrian bridge over the tracks. Lately people hang out at the bottom of the stairs making it difficult to navigate.
@ZiadFazel @klaszus @calgarytransit @DruhFarrell @nenshi I believe this is why they use the city of Calgary myID? I had assumed that the pass would be somehow stored in there rather than the app specifically.   It definitely boggles my mind that they didn't do proper beta testing and single-OS release.
@calgarytransit We have book of 10 tickets that we can still use ?

@calgarytransit 4, just blocking the way with their bodies and knapsacks. Not the first time either. Thanks.
@kintsugiko @calgarytransit @nenshi This is why masks should be mandatory for drivers. Disciplinary action needs to be taken if they don 2019t wear a mask.

Here we are at the end of the first day and Apple users are still unable to get the app.  Wouldn 2019t this have been taken care of in the testing phase ?  When can we expect it to be in the App Store?
@Botterilldave @calgarytransit So not surprised. @calgarytransit is disappointment again and again. And they wonder why ridership is down, and probably won't come back.
@BaffledPenguin @_FRESHPRINTZ_ @optiontrader44 @calgarytransit And here's Vancouver kicking our butts in the easy to use transit department. Geez, your think they could manage this!
@infromthewest @calgarytransit You can buy it whenever from wherever. Why do you need to buy in bulk? Makes no sense
@calgarytransit Your own advertising at train stations say the app is available on the App Store. @cityofcalgary website also says it 2019s available there too  d83d de1e
@calgarytransit Didn 2019t someone double check?
@calgarytransit Why do tickets expire after 7 days?
@calgarytransit @nenshi Absolutely ridiculous.  A complete and total failure on day one.
@calgarytransit where do you find your drivers? Driver of bus 22 number 8067 is a pure shit driver. Are they allowed to speed? If your drivers hate their job they should quit. What a asshole
@calgarytransit bus route 22 seriously needs better drivers. They don 2019t seem to comprehend their routes. What a joke our transit is.
RT @Botterilldave: @calgarytransit unreal..  3 time isnt the charm..    https://t.co/7wl9CsjiyQ
@rmondo67 @calgarytransit Except a lot of stores failed to stock up on paper passes with the assumption / directive from Calgary Transit that riders would go digital.
@LacrossFan @BaffledPenguin @_FRESHPRINTZ_ @optiontrader44 @calgarytransit To be fair....Vancouver had a baaad start going digital too.  Lots of riders were overcharged, passes wouldnt work properly  etc.
@tracyinkits @BaffledPenguin @_FRESHPRINTZ_ @optiontrader44 @calgarytransit Agreed, but it was a bit ago.  They are up and running now.  We are still behind :(
@LacrossFan @GlobalCalgary @calgarytransit I agree with CRob
@calgarytransit My folks are seniors. They have an appointment at the @kerbycenter but are scared to go to city hall and your customer service centers now due to COVID 19.  If I help them use the app can they purchase their seniors pass on it?
@calgarytransit where is the last 156 from stop 3855?
@calgarytransit lmao no tf it didnt, i was standing here at 10:14. your drivers suck.
@calgarytransit Thanks
@calgarytransit is the low income pass available on the app?
@calgarytransit Why do tickets only have seven days before they expire? I can't buy a book of ten, I can only buy five,... Great way to get bank fees add up.
@calgarytransit When you will be able to buy your low income pass on the App.
@calgarytransit  You guys should really get a system to tell people how long the next train will be! The last 3 times I've used the ctrain I've been met with, "Times temporarily unavailable". Just sloppy really Calgary is a great city we're better than this. It's the small things
@calgarytransit At Brentwood station, going towards tuscany
@calgarytransit I understand nothing's perfect but it just happens so much, if the wait time is 10 mins or 30 it could really change my plans! I wish it just told you!
@calgarytransit An all too familiar sight https://t.co/Yn8yPPNUST
@quinbus41 @calgarytransit It 2019s likely out of the developer 2019s hands in those of the Apple Release team who approves the apps for the Apple Store.  That said, this app should have been released a month ago so it would be ready to launch today as advertised.
@calgarytransit I can't even find it on Android
@Kathlee95027143 @calgarytransit They can 2019t afford to do that.  That 2019s why they both cut service and enforced fare payment during the recent states of the pandemic.

@calgarytransit Doesn 2019t work for iOS yet? You guys are a joke.
@calgarytransit Argh
The city made a promise and didn't deliver... at least not on time.

@calgarytransit   Is there a my fare ap yet for Apple?
Several people are complaining @calgarytransit should've let transit riders know they would still need paper tickets/physical passes instead of counting on the app... But a few are reporting some stores didn't stock up on paper tickets, assuming transit was going digital @660NEWS

@calgarytransit Got the My Fare bus pass activated but not scanning.  I know it's just new but have someone look at it, please. Thanks! By the way it is convenient, no need to go to a store to buy the pass!
I'd suggest it's not unlike what I have found when looking deeply into safety etc issues at @calgarytransit . A culture of contracting locally with long term vendors rather than seek best of the best elsewhere.  Problematic, IMO.
@calgarytransit I have it thru android! Bought the monthly pass, activated but not scanning when i board bus.  d83d de0a d83d de0a d83d de0a

Allowing 3 months of homeless people to destroy buses and ctrains. Not make app promises and when finally start charging have regular bus scheulde
@ooh_squirrel @calgarytransit Fit their pretend narrative
@Kzorith @Kathlee95027143 @calgarytransit Just fuckin aweful!
@kipsy1979 @calgarytransit @LacrossFan @Botterilldave Bus was never free, pay your fare and stfu
@HomelessCalgary @calgarytransit You want free transit yet bitch constantly about funding. Are you fucking stupid? https://t.co/JnmyaGnqlo
@calgarytransit No need to apologize! Giving feedback on the new app! Thank you!
And yet another reason why management there needs to beer shaken up.
@calgarytransit @JdheatonMr Ridiculous that this is even an issue. Someone needs to be held accountable for this massive failure.  How can we trust the app now that we have been let down massively in day one ?  Thought I 2019d was tested before rollout.  We want real answers.  Keep checking is not an answer.
So I got yelled at for trying to pay my fare on the bus, so I didn't bring any change the next time and I got yelled at for not paying? What is it? Do we pay to get on the bus or not? @calgarytransit
@calgarytransit Bus is the 19, #8346. This time passengers were let on from the front. It is just a really mixed message and I don't know what the hell to do when I get on a bus anymore.
We are OPEN AGAIN d83d de0a Located at 809 7 Street SW, one block away from @calgarytransit  d83e dd6f https://t.co/HPVR5ZzOte
@calgarytransit I know we have had our differences in the past, but I must give praise where praise is do! This new Myfare digital ticket app is everything okayyyyyyy! Gwan wit yo bad self! I'm here for it !!!
@calgarytransit I can scan my myfare pass on any other buses but bus number 10. Why is that? How can I fix that because it's so annoying and embarrassing.
typical @calgarytransit Fuck Up!
@calgarytransit The bigger question is, why do single tickets expire on the app after a week? The printed tickets, in books of ten, have no such expiration date.
@calgarytransit https://t.co/xEm5jXlp5s
@calgarytransit https://t.co/Otilj43OEC
@calgarytransit That doesn't explain WHY they have expiry dates to begin with.
@vipertwosix @calgarytransit Printed tickets do have an expiration, they effectively expire when there is a ticket price increase.  There is a loop hole for printed tickets, if you have cash for the fare increase, the printed ticket plus coins can be deposited into bus fare box and a transfer/receipt issued.
@calgarytransit LOSERS!
@calgarytransit How about low income passes please?
@calgarytransit @vipertwosix You don't explain WHY!  Once again, in small words: Why do tickets on the app expire, when physical tickets do not?
@calgarytransit @vipertwosix I'm using printed tickets = book of 10 printed tickets that require validation through stamp.  Printed tickets from the LRT vending machines come all ready validated and expire 90 minutes after pruchase.   Am I missing something?
@calgarytransit @vipertwosix If I buy a book of 10 tickets in November and validate a ticket the following January after the price has increased $0.15; that validation is not effective. This is from numerous transit peace officers who conduct fare validation checks in January.
@calgarytransit I can't find the MyFare App in the Google Play Store.  A search for MyFare turns up nothing other than the existing Calgary Transit App.
@calgarytransit @ExplorewithAga So it 2019s still inconvenient for those of us that need low income passes
@calgarytransit This is not good enough.  We want answers as to why this happened.
@calgarytransit How long is the process going to take ?
@calgarytransit @CageYYC @vipertwosix Confusion due to over the years twitter acct said 2 different things - yes, still valid; no aren't; plus conflicting responses from transit drivers too (downtown office says don't expire).  Now new app.  It's an internal &amp; external policy awareness &amp; inconsistent messaging issue.
@calgarytransit Thank you!  Found it!!
@calgarytransit @CageYYC @vipertwosix By 'valid' people think yes, ok to use at face value (even if price increase), or, yes, can use them (but have to pay top up increase).  So if have a paper ticket for $1. &amp; price now $1.25, inconsistent messaging whether you have to pay the extra .25 (or not) &amp; what 'valid' means
@calgarytransit bus route 23, it 2019s now a small shuttle, it 2019s impossible to follow social distancing. Please check on that.
@calgarytransit How long will it take for my bus pass to be mailed to me I purchased it June 26 and it 2019s July 2 now

@PostmaFineArt @calgarytransit @CageYYC Clearly, @calgarytransit , you have some details to sort out. How about you get back to us in a day or two, once things are a tad clearer, and then pass that info on to your drivers and peace officers, so everyone is on the same page. There's no shame in this. But fix it. @nenshi
@calgarytransit @ExplorewithAga You already get a discount, and the process has not changed, so not sure what the problem is
@CageYYC @calgarytransit @vipertwosix You can also take your pre-increase tickets to customer service and use them as a credit toward purchasing current tickets. Their value never just disappears.
@calgarytransit @Tia53805729 Passes are available online on the 6th of the month, even earlier than retail. They mail very quickly, usually 2 business days (1 for the city, 1 for Canada Post), but of course they can take longer.
@calgarytransit   If a bureaucrat working on a project, actually gets it done, then he/she is out of a job.  So they show progress from time to time, but never actually get finished.  They've been working on this cashless fare project for over 10 years.
@WNDXSchool @GlobalCalgary And keep in mind that this is no less than #yyycc's *third* attempt to launch a payment app for @CalgaryTransit. This @CBCCalgary article from 2017. https://t.co/xEfpbTNKba
@calgarytransit @Jolty Between this and the Twitter conversation around whether physical tickets are valid only at face value or valid period definitely sounds like a lack of communication within Calgary Transit.  It sounds like your drivers and transit officers are not working on the same information.
@calgarytransit how come people are getting on and off at the front of the bus again? Unsafe. The drivers plastic curtain isnt even pulled all the way to protect the driver... https://t.co/zHffEXl6AZ
@MarcelinaJ @calgarytransit I went into the office a day last week for the first time since this started and the c-train felt like the least safe part of the experience (by a wide margin).   d83e dd14
I wonder... is transsubc-trainstation the act of using a promise that you're heading to buy a @calgarytransit pass as a form of bus fare?
@calgarytransit Thank you  d83d de0a
@calgarytransit Then what 2019s the point of these? https://t.co/sMmirPIPcf
@calgarytransit @calgarytransit then what is the point of these? Like what? https://t.co/FcqLudWDng
@calgarytransit Love it
@calgarytransit So i asked a driver why they were letting people through the front door, they were very nice. They said it was because @calgarytransit is losing money on people not paying fairs, what a shock! At least this driver was actually using the plastic screen.
@xXHidekaneXx @calgarytransit They havent taken all of the signs off of all the buses yet. That will be removed
@AmyTanMD @jkwan_md @SharkawyMD @KashPrime @jvipondmd @danfurst @robshirkey @nenshi @doniveson @calgarytransit @takeETSalert Great stuff ! Great leadership !  Its been a painful 3 months waiting for masking to become a "thing"
@calgarytransit just used My Fare for the first time  Showed it to the scanner and it said "Just Used" even though I just activated it Had to show the driver I just activated it for him to let me on
Thanks @calgarytransit ! Is it possible to know if they will be available later today or tomorrow?
@calgarytransit It okay me right now the my fare not out on iOS (apple user) I shave booklets of ticket to last me until it out.
@JaviNico24 @calgarytransit @ExplorewithAga I agree. This is 2020 @calgarytransit should have a login system to buy your passes regardless of what type of pass you purchase then implement that into the MyFare app
@calgarytransit just tried again on different bus  It said "Regular Show ID" for about 3 seconds, then went away. Driver told me to try again and it said "Just Used" again  It's a youth single ticket, that I purchased yesterday and activated at 2pm Why is it doing this?
@gimli_cat @calgarytransit @nenshi I thought they were supposed to be mandatory?
@calgarytransit Thank you
@calgarytransit  are passengers still able to pay a cash fare on buses
@calgarytransit Ok thank you
@k_mitch22 @calgarytransit Valid point. For me it's about limiting transactions
@kintsugiko @calgarytransit @nenshi Nope. Not mandatory.  Just a suggestion.
@calgarytransit I usually buy a low income bus pass. I just ordered one online so how do a take transit until the pass comes in
@calgarytransit when will Victoria Park be closing? 13th?
@calgarytransit I 2019m referring to the big project;  201cConstruction on the project will begin after the Stampede next year, and is expected to take three years to complete. 201d
@calgarytransit Ones again the bus #147 to the 39ave station.  4:20 pm isn't stopping and leaving people on the bus stops  because they have 10 people already on the bus. Maybe is a good time to get a large bus or maybe you should stop and let the people get on if we are wearing a mark?
@calgarytransit what's the current procedure for old tickets purchased when there were lower fares? Do they need to be topped up? Thanks!
On the @calgarytransit, heading downtown  I'm the only one on this bus wearing a goddamn mask and I'm so disappointed.  #yyc

@PostmaFineArt @calgarytransit @CageYYC @vipertwosix You are exactly correct.  Too often the left hand and right hand are not in synch.  The Calgary Transit staff often don't know the rules themselves.
@calgarytransit @Shani_Aleda When did this change? In the past, we needed to top up with cash or turn the tickets in (for credit toward buying new tickets).
@calgarytransit @CageYYC @vipertwosix If this is true, why are people being harassed every January by peace officers over a supposed ten or fifteen cents deficiency?  @JeromyYYC @DougGMorgan @nenshi
@vipertwosix @calgarytransit Exactly.  Explain why these single tickets expire in just seven days.  Does Calgary Transit properly think through the rationale of their decisions?  @JeromyYYC @DougGMorgan
@BScribbins @calgarytransit @CageYYC @vipertwosix Agree, Brian, thank you.  It's often not in sync.  Hoping helps them in some small way by sharing info.   Appreciate all they do; if they know what we have seen  (for years now), perhaps they can address it.  Maybe staff training/turnover; not sure what root cause is exactly.
Hi, @calgarytransit  I understand that if you pay for a ticket with #MyFareApp and take the CTrain, peace officers can demand to see the ticket on your phone.  That opens a pretty huge can of worms. What rules are in place to prevent officers from going through your phone?
@king4nosehill @calgarytransit what if your battery dies?

@joelaf @calgarytransit They cover that one in the FAQ. You're up a creek. https://t.co/kLd7hF0MFP
@king4nosehill @calgarytransit charged for having no charge
@joelaf @king4nosehill @calgarytransit Then pay cash.
@calgarytransit @joelaf @king4nosehill This is a POOR response. You clearly haven 2019t had a busy day where you are running around and next thing you know your phone is almost dead.
@king4nosehill @calgarytransit Well then maybe we should just stick to cash and paper tickets.
Um @calgarytransit should the 14 going into Bridlewood have a driver? Because right now we're just sitting at the station with no one...
@BScribbins @calgarytransit @CageYYC @vipertwosix This good reading on ticket issue - same as we've seen. Pay extra, don't, fun 1 that if you use them (per the Driver) you will get fined.  Just reading thread should give some insight how confused customer is with mixed messaging from various transit reps. https://t.co/LrevOlwRUt
@calgarytransit Thank you very much
@calgarytransit any news ? COVID-19 Updates: Two transit drivers test positive ?

@calgarytransit Fail. Plain and simple. This should have been worked out before you touted how great it was all over the news.
@BScribbins @calgarytransit @CageYYC @vipertwosix Looks like (if up to date) Clr. Jeff Davison (ward 6) is Leader/Chair past 3 years, responsible for public transit  (&amp; launch/no Apple app problem too)?    Lists entire Committee responsible:  Standing Policy Committee on Transportation and Transit. https://t.co/8uaAEa0aRx
Hey @calgarytransit! Why aren 2019t your drivers wearing masks?
@calgarytransit what does the app look like in the App Store
@calgarytransit Apple App store
@calgarytransit Thank you
@ResistanceAB @calgarytransit @joelaf @king4nosehill I 2019m afraid it will really be a case of tough shit
RT @king4nosehill: Hi, @calgarytransit  I understand that if you pay for a ticket with #MyFareApp and take the CTrain, peace officers can d 2026
@calgarytransit I saw that the reason this app was launched to prevent people from interacting with your staff reducing the chance of getting COVID 19. If that is true how come seniors and people living in poverty can 2019t get their pass  on it yet?
RT @king4nosehill: Hi, @calgarytransit  I understand that if you pay for a ticket with #MyFareApp and take the CTrain, peace officers can d 2026
@ResistanceAB @calgarytransit @joelaf @king4nosehill Phone is dead then you can 2019t produce a valid fare on demand. Ticket for you I guess
@king4nosehill @calgarytransit Why would the officer need to go into your phone? You show the pass on the app. They scan it. And you are done. Not sure what you think is going to happen here?
@calgarytransit Both groups are in the high risk categories.  https://t.co/bUiPlw5BjE  https://t.co/pncafeinSy
@calgarytransit The reason poor people are at risk is because they can 2019t self isolate when they got no place to call home, they can 2019t afford to buy hand sanitizer/ mask etc... due to being food insecure they may develop disease like diabetes. https://t.co/gNHTk9NnuY
@nenshi @DruhFarrell  when we don 2019t help the poor and the elderly people by reducing in person contact, we may be making the spread of COVID 19 worse. Include their low income and seniors bus passes on the app please.
@C31551 @king4nosehill @calgarytransit Which remain available. No plans to phase out.
@ZiadFazel @klaszus @dbinyyc @calgarytransit @DruhFarrell @nenshi Calgary Transit never answered question nor updated FAQs on privacy. Found this. Seems they are tracking location; 'senses' if you'll miss your bus (tracking real time).  Should be disclosed on FAQ before people download it where data is stored, users, etc https://t.co/kE6uLQW71z
@calgarytransit Will low income passes ever be available with MyFare?
@calgarysun @calgarytransit how come your  drivers aren 2019t required to wear mask? #maskupCanada #mask4allcanadians if you want ridersto wear the mask you 2019re giving to them, staff should lead by example and wear it. @nenshi @DruhFarrell @BigRedyyc   https://t.co/IxHRhwzGTI https://t.co/eCu3RPfijG
@43Parks @C31551 @king4nosehill @calgarytransit You're confusing paying for an ap and wanting an ap as the same thing
@k_mitch22 @king4nosehill @calgarytransit Some peoples texts pop up on the screen. If a text/email comes through and the officer decides it looks suspicious...
@calgarysun @calgarytransit your drivers need to be protected better. Since drivers do step off their bus during their time breaks and when someone needs help boarding the vehicles please give them a mask to wear. That way the public will be encouraged to wear the mask CT gives properly. https://t.co/8Ohp4X0sEY
@calgarysun @calgarytransit @nenshi @DruhFarrell @gccarra drivers deserve to have the mask they need while they are at a bus stop or standing on the Ctrain platform. Not just while they are inside the vehicles
@asadyyc @C31551 @calgarytransit Given that paper tickets no longer expire when the fare goes up, I can only see disadvantages to using the app.
It 2019s actually strike three, @calgarytransit ...millions $ lost on two failed attempts with the Telvent Schneider smart connect card.  Lots of major cities, bigger than YYC with electronic transit pay systems that work for everyone!
@king4nosehill @C31551 @calgarytransit It 2019s great for tourists and family groups who don 2019t typically take transit and won 2019t be boarding at a location that has a vending machine. I 2019ll also be using it for monthly pass
@king4nosehill @calgarytransit I'm not a lawyer, but isn't there a ruling that police officers in Canada may access your phone if is unlocked?  They should only be able to scan the code on the app without touching you or the phone.  When you use the app, the phone is unlocked.
@Loki_Lyesmythe @king4nosehill @calgarytransit Your tinfoil hat is on to tight.....
@Calgarytransit : Driver of bus 124 enroute towards North point at 9:20pm.. Please fix your headlamps which you were flashing for no reason and follow traffic rules where there is construction without honking... You blinded small car drivers like me and honked at us for no reason

@vamputee @calgarytransit That should have all been taken care of before they launched.  That should have been discovered in testing. They don 2019t even have scanners on all of the busses yet.

@calgarytransit @vipertwosix That sounds like a cash grab.
@shut_up_mary @calgarytransit First time seeing a new apple app release eh?
@shut_up_mary @vamputee @calgarytransit Or got to ride the bus for free more likely. You should be complaining on apples page really, they the ones to blame, and they always pull shifty stuff.
@vipertwosix @calgarytransit Thats a good question. Seems odd they would be any different. Although, if its just single tickets, then it shouldn't make much difference. If 10 packs had an expiry then that would be an issue.
@calgarytransit Took #31 from Lion's Park to McMahon about 8:15-8:30 PM. Best I can do. She had a shoulder-length bob if that helps.
@_FRESHPRINTZ_ @vamputee @calgarytransit No.  It 2019s the developer and transit.  They dropped the ball.  The taxpayers paid a ton of money to get the app and they failed. Riding the bus isn 2019t free.  You are still expected to pay if you can 2019t get the app.
@calgarytransit I would appreciate if you let the operator of 1827 know why he shouldn't skip stops and blow right past riders.  Route 156, 5:06am.

@calgarytransit seems the myfare app is working now on iOS https://t.co/rSG7A0S2i3
@macphersonmattm @calgarytransit That 2019s the way it 2019s supposed to work - you used a youth ticket, so the driver knows to check that you 2019re really a youth. And you can 2019t scan your ticket on the same bus so quickly after the first.
Transit payment apps should use NFC and be tap based, for a variety of reasons, but this is certainly a big one.
@calgarytransit will Victoria Park be shut down in the coming weeks for the planned demolition?

Not so much right now.
@k_mitch22 @king4nosehill @calgarytransit Police are given a wide definition of suspicious activity. Nervous a cop has your phone, refusal to let it go, several texts pinging at 6am, even 2 cell phones can trigger a cop.

@k_mitch22 @king4nosehill @calgarytransit If you've ever taken transit you've seen them walk past the sleeping white guy and wake up the native demanding pass, asking where they're going.
@k_mitch22 @king4nosehill @calgarytransit Ok there bud... You got me...
@k_mitch22 @Loki_Lyesmythe @calgarytransit I would guess that most people have never once thought about how the data on their device could seem suspicious to a cop and be used against them, and what they might do about it. That's what makes this "show your phone to transit police" policy so dangerous.
@king4nosehill @Loki_Lyesmythe @calgarytransit How would they know if you have purchased a fare then? They have psychic abilities?
@Blanchard_Mike @calgarytransit Haha why do guys care? If you bought a single ticket at the train station it would expire in 2 hours. If you want a book buy a book lol
@shut_up_mary @vamputee @calgarytransit I dont think you know how the apps work if you just said that and only believe that. Riding the bus isn't free no, but if someone showed up already paid for their apple ticket and it was broken, you can't believe the bus driver made those riders get off the bus.
@_FRESHPRINTZ_ @vamputee @calgarytransit You missed the whole point but ok.  Thanks for your very useless input.
@_FRESHPRINTZ_ @vamputee @calgarytransit The point was that the app was unavailable to hundreds of thousands of people. Duh.
@calgarytransit @king4nosehill The question isn't whether they need you to leave the app but whether they could legally take the now-unlocked phone and look through it. A Canadian border officer told me to unlock my phone at the airport a few years back so she could look through it...not sure how that's legal.
@shiggerbog @Blanchard_Mike @calgarytransit I think you 2019re missing the point. When you  201cbuy a book 201d imagine if those tickets expired after 7 days whether used or not? That would be obnoxious, and also pointless.
@Blanchard_Mike @calgarytransit Another reason why this app is a huge failure and disappointment.
@calgarytransit how do I add/can I add my already purchased monthly pass to the app?
@k_mitch22 @king4nosehill @calgarytransit I can see you are a regular transit user. -Monthly Pass Cards -Printed Tickets This app nonsense is to eventually remove those means. CT said in the thread it's your responsibility to keep your phone charged or get the massive fines.

@calgarytransit @Blanchard_Mike This doesn 2019t make any sense at all, and should be corrected as soon as possible.  201cPlanning ahead 201d would be to buy tickets ahead of time so you have them when you need them.

@macphersonmattm @calgarytransit It would show a yellow light, as opposed to a green light for a normal pass - if the driver sees the light, they should know.
@honestbusdriver @calgarytransit When the bus has already been sitting for a while and is then running late I have a problem with it. I fully understand that drivers are entitled to breaks, I pay for the bus to run on time though
@calgarytransit again today. It seems that because I'm using a youth ticket that I have to show my ID, But the scanner flashes red when it says show ID, making the driver think it's declined and they make me try again, which makes it say Just used. Train your driver's please
@SleepingMoose @calgarytransit I just used it again 5 minutes ago, it shows a red flashing light and a denied sound, no yellow light

@TheDaveCA @Blanchard_Mike @calgarytransit But you 2019re not buying a book your buying a single ticket

@calgarytransit I called the customer service line and there is a complaint put in. Honestly, I get it with unstamped new tickets, but time stamped tickets shouldn't be taken unless its expired. It had another hour left until it expired.
On June 15th, 1987 I moved to Calgary from Sask to find work. I was given 2 weeks by the relatives I was staying with &amp; on the last day of looking a @calgarytransit driver tipped me to a job at @calgarystampede. Today was my 1st day of work 33 years ago &amp; made me an Albertans.
@calgarytransit having tickets expire is terrible. For many of us we need to stock up when we get paid and save them, they shouldn 2019t expire ever! How is it Red deer has a better system then you do? There cards don 2019t expire and show how many uses left each swipe.
@calgarytransit Real professional attitude for drivers to complain they hate driving the route they are on with a full bus load. Route 42 that left Marlborough Station just before 6pm. Couldn't get bus number due to my vision.
@calgarytransit They were talking with another driver while at the station, (other driver was from the 43. Both were complaining about driving routes in Marlborough and dealing with people therein. Which felt insulting to a resident of that area.

@calgarytransit why do completely unused tickets on the myfare app expire after 7 days?
@MarcelinaJ @calgarytransit Oh no. This is also what I am the most worried about. Are masks mandatory?
@calgarytransit @MarcelinaJ Thank you. As more and more people return to work I wish they would become mandatory.
@calgarytransit And if dont use smartphone?
@calgarytransit It would be the stop at intersection 52st NE and Skyview Ranch Landing NE. Not sure what the stop number is unfortunately.
@ComeonmanYYC @calgarytransit I completely agree!! There shouldn't be an expiration date on single tickets. Not to mention how many people in the city cannot afford to buy more tickets often if their plans or medical appts change and they cant use it and lose that money. There are people on tight budgets.
@calgarytransit how do you use Apple Pay with MyFare?

Just used @calgarytransit My Fare App for the first time! I have questions about ticket bundles and low income bus passes in hopes to make the app accessible for all @cityofcalgary Calgarians so I will be sure to provide my feedback #CTRiders https://t.co/lRI9uvCmFY
@calgarytransit just wondering if the elevator at Marlbourgh station is up and running now
@calgarytransit Kind of frustrating when coming from downtown with 2 children ...1 in a stroller
Hey @calgarytransit, just wanted to report that someone hass pooped inside the bus shelter. The stop number is 7532. Your office is closed so I could not call it in. Maybe stay open later
@calgarytransit I can use My Fare for a standard monthly pass too?
@calgarytransit Nice so no more running around to different places. I can purchase from the comfort of my couch!!
@calgarytransit I got my pass today and used the app. I 2019m pretty happy with it!  d83d de00
@calgarytransit Been back to work since May 14th. Haven't seen one 4 car train on the LRT. Hard to social distance on 3 crowded cars.
@calgarytransit @nenshi How could homeless people get jobs if they can't afford to even travel to them?
@calgarytransit Thanks so much!
@calgarytransit Yahoo
@calgarytransit Please make masks mandatory.
@calgarytransit It worked great
@calgarytransit with the new My Fare app - as a parent can I log in and purchase a youth monthly pass and  201csend/give/share it with my teenager ?
@calgarytransit Probably should consider ysing a pic of someone boarding the bus with a mask 2026 at least for a few months.
@calgarytransit Perhaps only people wearing a mask should be able to enter the front doors. ???
I'm starting to agree, based on accounts from @calgarytransit @nenshi @AdrianaLaGrange
@calgarytransit Thanks! I sometime take transit while supporting a person with a disability. He wears his mask to protect others. Others should also protect him.
@nenshi @calgarytransit no distancing. No masks except me.  Make them mandatory https://t.co/DUssXFKb5u
@calgarytransit Thank you for the update. Now that I have already bought the physical pass for July, is there a way I can add my physical pass in my "My Fare" app?
@calgarytransit What about the busses?

@calgarytransit Thank you.
@calgarytransit Sounds perfect. Yes I have the app installed on my phone. I'll drop by the centre. Thank you
@calgarytransit can we please have a bus that goes to market mall prior to 11 am? I arrived at Brentwood Station at 10:15 and the next bus available is at 10:45 minimum.... i have to be at work by 10:45 i thought being at the station 30mins before my shift would be enough time...
@calgarytransit There's 3 busses, the 53, 65 and the 408 if any of those routes could leave from Brentwood at lets say 10:25-10:30 it would be much appreciated from people who work at the mall. Cheers!
@calgarytransit when my #myfare tickets expire without being used do I get refunded for them?
Hey @calgarytransit there is a person underneath the seats on the middle  Train cart on train number 2401 heading to summerset, not sure if the person is sleeping or passed out.
@calgarytransit I 2019m not sure if they require medical attention . I noticed when I was getting off the train at City Hall.
@calgarytransit White sneakers, black or dark blue sweat pants
@calgarytransit Not sure if the person is male or female, I could only see the legs.
@calgarytransit  Loaded Myfare app for my IPhone, but when I look at the conditions single ride tickets expire after 7 days?? Is that right? https://t.co/uNcK2fhjAa
@calgarytransit Why?
@calgarytransit Are you saying the emergency ticket I've carried in my wallet since 2007 has been replaced by technology?
@calgarytransit Works great, but I wish tickets didn't expire in a week. Could that be set for a month? I'd like to just buy a batch in advance instead of one by one.
@calgarytransit It's pretty great! I like the countdown that tells you how much time is left l a ticket, too.
@calgarytransit making masks mandatory on Transit would help bolster passenger loads would it not?  Shouldn't that happen?  Covid isn't going away - its still here and will be for awhile.
@calgarytransit Why can't you guys also digitize the Low income bus pass? Would be nice to not have to wait for them to arrive in the mail. Just thought I would give my 2 cents.

@MassTransitmag  @OttTransitRider
@calgarytransit  if I have a monthly pass ( new my fare pass) do I scan it every time when I get on a  bus or just show it to driver?
@calgarytransit Oh thank you.
@calgarytransit What is the purpose behind the 7 day expiration
@calgarytransit  why do your online tickets expire 7 days after purchase? Is there a reason for this? the paper tickets were good for as long as you held them so why should the tickets via my app be any different?
